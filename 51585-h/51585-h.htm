<h2><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>CHAPTER
I<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE STREET OF ADVENTURE</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Books</span> beget books, even when they
are books of autobiography.&nbsp; Not that the writer of
reminiscence will admit as much.&nbsp; He is&mdash;if you believe
him&mdash;the victim of an irrepressible impulse, or he has at
length (usually at great length) yielded to the solicitations of
a large circle of acquaintances.&nbsp; I am impelled to my
present enterprise by no sense of my own aptitude, nor have my
discerning friends urged that some record of my experiences would
supply a long-felt want.&nbsp; My book&mdash;like a great many
other books&mdash;owes its existence to a book that went before
it.&nbsp; In other and plainer words, if Mr. Philip Gibbs had not
written his novel entitled &ldquo;The Street of Adventure,&rdquo;
this present collection of reminiscences would never have been
attempted.&nbsp; And I should, perhaps, apologize to Mr. Gibbs
for saddling him with the awful responsibility.&nbsp; The novel
to which allusion has been made&mdash;and a very excellent one it
is&mdash;suddenly, but with much distinctness, suggested my
course.&nbsp; The muck-rake of reminiscence is deliberately taken
up because I represent a condition of Press life that has
apparently ceased to exist.&nbsp; If one accepts the statements
of Mr. Gibbs&mdash;and there is every reason why one
should&mdash;the Fleet Street of to-day bears no sort of
resemblance to the Fleet Street of yesterday.&nbsp; If I describe
the London Press and the London Pressman of less than <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>two decades
ago, I am describing a state of things that has been reformed off
the face of the earth, and a race of men extinct as the Dodo.</p>
<p>To an old member of the Press this is the real significance of
&ldquo;The Street of Adventure,&rdquo; for the story
describes&mdash;with entire candour and accuracy; one can
entertain no doubt about that&mdash;the working of the
Metropolitan Press and its personnel as they exist at this the
dawn of the century.&nbsp; I have read chapter after chapter of
the story with a growing sentiment of astonishment and
dismay.&nbsp; The accomplished author describes, at first hand, a
conjuncture of men and conditions so different to that existing
in my time that I completely fail to recognize in this picture of
the present a single salient characteristic of the past.&nbsp;
Had the writer discovered for us evidences of a natural progress
of evolution, a survival of fitness, an institution rising on
stepping-stones of its dead self to higher things, this book had
never been conceived.&nbsp; But this melancholy tale suggests a
sad and sudden deterioration, the inauguration of a period of
decadence, the setting in of a newspaper rot.&nbsp; It is in the
belief that a certain interest must centre about times that have
gone beyond recall, and round the names of the men whose
successors are ruthlessly painted for us in the pages before me,
that I address myself to the task of fixing the random
recollection of some twenty jocund years.</p>
<p>During the seventies and eighties I knew my Fleet Street
well.&nbsp; I worked among its presses; was on intimate terms
with many of its most famous habitu&eacute;s; revelled in its
atmosphere; and, in a word, lived its strenuous but happy
life.&nbsp; And I would wish no better now&mdash;could such
things be&mdash;than to live it all over again: granted, of
course, that I lived it under the same conditions and among the
same companions.&nbsp; Under the conditions and among the
companions described in &ldquo;The Street of Adventure,&rdquo; a
survivor of the seventies or eighties would find life
intolerable.&nbsp; For the conditions, as described, are
degrading, and the companionship unwholesome and
depressing.&nbsp; It is impossible to catch the new atmosphere,
to visualize the new journalist.&nbsp; And any nascent desire I
may once have <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>cherished to visit the scenes of my ancient labours has
been effectually quenched by the perusal of these squalid
records.</p>
<p>The time occupied in the unfolding of the drama which marks
our author&rsquo;s starting-point commences with the founding of
an important daily paper, and ends with the foundering of the
same.&nbsp; The <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i> belong entirely to
the staff of the wonderful party organ, with the proprietor,
shadowy but maleficent, brooding over the adventure like a gloomy
and heartily detested Fate.&nbsp; In making the acquaintance of
the members of the staff I am being introduced to a new
race.&nbsp; I recognize nothing in character, equipment, or even
in physique, that for a moment recalls the figures of the
past.&nbsp; For &ldquo;there were giants on the earth in those
days.&rdquo;&nbsp; The characters represented here are
an&aelig;mic, neurotic, hysterical.&nbsp; Their professional
avocation brings them into competition with women, and the
conditions of their service involves working with them as
colleagues and accepting them as comrades.&nbsp; This intimate
professional association may account for the hysterics&mdash;to
some extent.&nbsp; But it does not account for the infinite
joylessness which is the dominant note of the record.&nbsp; The
various characters seem to move in a fuliginous cloud beyond
which they are always scenting disaster.&nbsp; Should the
disaster ensue, they are as men and women without hope.&nbsp;
When, in effect, the dreaded calamity does overtake
them&mdash;not without due notice&mdash;they are like mountain
sheep in a thunder-storm: awe-stricken and helpless.&nbsp; We of
a brisker time might, under similar circumstances, have imitated
sheep in that we would have had recourse to our
&ldquo;damns.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the gentlemen of &ldquo;The Street
of Adventure&rdquo; have not spirit enough even for that.&nbsp;
To change the figure: Their ship has foundered; they abandon
themselves to their fate, for not one of them can swim.</p>
<p>Now, in the times of which I am about to record a few personal
impressions, total disaster of the kind described here was
impossible.&nbsp; That is to say, collapse of a newspaper did not
involve the endowment of the individual members of its staff with
the key of the street.&nbsp; For although the <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>failure of a
journal&mdash;and I have watched over the last hours of more than
one or two of them&mdash;might mean a temporary crippling and a
serious curtailment of income to certain members of the staff, it
never involved a drought in all the springs of income.&nbsp; For
even the most important writers on the staff of a daily newspaper
had other irons in the fire.&nbsp; Indeed, the more important the
writer, the greater the number of fires offered for the
accommodation of his irons.&nbsp; But the adventurers in this new
Fleet Street are represented as being bound body and soul to a
single proprietor.&nbsp; They are in thrall to one insistent
master.&nbsp; In the morning they are expected to report
themselves at the office, and are then to take their places in a
sort of common-room waiting for orders, much as messenger-boys at
their call-centres lounge around waiting for their
&ldquo;turn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The atmosphere, as I endeavour to catch it from these
illuminating pages, is that of a barracks&mdash;barracks provided
for an army where women serve in the ranks.&nbsp; One by one the
anxious, nervous waiters are sent on their several
missions.&nbsp; Their tasks are not of a very cheerful or
inspiring kind.&nbsp; Crime-hunting, according to Mr. Gibbs,
appears to be a tremendous &ldquo;feature&rdquo; in the journals
of the period, and the crime-hunter, as observed by him, is the
most virile (perhaps I had rather say the least effeminate) of
these queer adventurers.&nbsp; He, at all events, &ldquo;lives
up&rdquo; to his mission, and even provides his home with an
object-lesson in the social strata through which he works in
search of his quarry, for he has taken under his
&ldquo;protection&rdquo; a member of the criminal classes, and
established her as mistress of his flat in Battersea.&nbsp;
Pretty well this for one of the most distinguished members of the
staff of a leading Metropolitan journal! and quaint reading for
those who belong to other times, and illustrated&mdash;I am happy
to think&mdash;other manners.&nbsp; If, however, the ladies and
gentlemen of the newspaper staff of the period are depicted as
eccentric in both conduct and appearance, their conversation when
they forgather in their gaollike common-room, or in their
favourite taverns, is neither bright nor edifying.&nbsp; They
interchange some cheap philosophical reflections, and
occasionally employ a preciosity <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>of diction which, introduced in the
eighties, was laughed out of Fleet Street by the men of that
bustling time.&nbsp; Beyond these exchanges of conversational
mock-jewellery, their talk is all of &ldquo;shop.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And deadly dull it is.&nbsp; The poor creatures never deviate
into fun.&nbsp; Their young lives are coloured by a sense of
apprehension and oppression.&nbsp; To them the newspaper is an
awful mother.&nbsp; Yet her death means the sealing-up of the
founts by which they live.&nbsp; And all their thoughts are grey
and melancholy in anticipation of the imminent catastrophe.&nbsp;
When eventually the long-anticipated doom is announced, the
sensation of the reader is that of relief.&nbsp; The chapter in
which the disaster is set forth is, as a piece of writing, so
forcible and so convincing that one is driven to the conclusion
that the writer is describing an actual occurrence.&nbsp; And the
victims?&nbsp; Does their conduct under the final stroke evoke
our sympathy as their apologist evidently means that it
should?&nbsp; Personally I am conscious of no sentiments other
than those of pity and contempt.&nbsp; When the proprietor makes
the announcement that he has gone the limit, and that no further
issue of his costly and ill-fated paper will be made, some of the
men are described as weeping; all are more or less
hysterical.&nbsp; The busy builders of an overturned ant-heap
arouse our admiration by their courage and capacity and
resource.&nbsp; The pitiable creatures who crawl out into the
night from the crumbling press-heap of Fleet Street can but
provoke a gibe.&nbsp; Some of them seek the oblivion purchasable
in public-houses&mdash;for the journalist in &ldquo;The Street of
Adventure&rdquo; understands a tavern only as a place in which to
get drunk&mdash;others seek consolation in the flats of the lady
members of the staff, an expedient more sober at once and more
economical.&nbsp; I quit their society with pleasure.&nbsp; They
belong to a marrowless, joyless, invertebrate breed; seedy,
selfish, but superior persons, affording at all times a safe
medium for maleficent mind-microbes on the prowl after a reliable
culture.</p>
<p>If &ldquo;The Street of Adventure&rdquo; supplies a
cinematographic record of the London journalistic life of to-day,
it should be well worth while, I think, to compose some account
of the <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>very different conditions prevailing on the Press less
than two decades ago; to present some fairly recognizable
sketches of the gentlemen of the Press who bore the burden and
heat of that day; to indicate the manner in which our cheery
duties were discharged; and&mdash;a more difficult
matter&mdash;to render, if possible, something of the atmosphere
of the period.&nbsp; My own experience, roughly speaking, covers
a period of twenty years.&nbsp; It extends from 1870 to
1890.&nbsp; The mere record of a few of the names of those with
whom at one time or another I became associated indicates at once
the great gulf fixed between the Then and the Now.&nbsp; There
were, among others, George Augustus Sala, Godfrey Turner,
&ldquo;Scholar&rdquo; Williams, Edmund Yates, Gilbert Venables,
Tom Purnell, Archibald Forbes, Captain Hamber, George Henty, John
Augustus O&rsquo;Shea, Edmund O&rsquo;Donovan, Hilary Skinner,
Charles Williams, Henry Pearse, John Lovell.&nbsp; In the mere
matter of physique this short catalogue suggests another age of
journalists.&nbsp; Imagine these men, or any one of them, being
thrown into hysterics by the failure of a newspaper to pay its
way.&nbsp; Fancy Forbes in tears over the <i>Daily News</i>
reduced to a halfpenny!&nbsp; Or Edmund O&rsquo;Donovan, on the
morrow of his proprietor&rsquo;s financial ruin, seeking balm for
his wounded spirit in the flats of lady colleagues!</p>
<p>By the nature of his calling the journalist is thrown much
into contact with those outside his profession.&nbsp; The
descriptive writer and special correspondent touches life at all
points.&nbsp; A memorable struggle in the Commons House; the more
lurid impact of armies; coronations; first nights at the theatre;
command nights at the opera; the funerals of statesmen;
prize-fights&mdash;the thousand pageants that make up the passing
show called &ldquo;public life&rdquo;&mdash;these were approached
by the Press correspondents, not in the spirit of nervous
despondency described as characterizing the attitude of the
puppets of Mr. Gibbs.&nbsp; My contemporaries went to work in an
optimistic mood, mixed with the pageant with an air of cheery
familiarity, and recorded their impressions in articles which
would be considered nowadays as too picturesque, too vigorous,
and too literary in style.&nbsp; Their <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>functions brought them into pleasant
contact with the heroes of whom they sung.&nbsp; They were given
to looking at things from the inside as well as from the
outside.&nbsp; They made friendships among the Parliament men,
the pugilists, the pulpiteers, and the players, of whose exploits
they were the chartered chroniclers.&nbsp; If an acquired
familiarity with social functions of every sort could constitute
a Society man, then the journalist of my period
should&mdash;after a long and exhausting experience&mdash;possess
all the gifts and graces of that ineffable being.&nbsp; And at
the least his retrospect should be of the most pleasant
description.&nbsp; He will recall with delight his experience of
the dandies and the dullards, the wits and the wantons, with whom
he came in contact during his excursions in those higher
altitudes.&nbsp; Actors and actresses were, of course, his
ordinary prey.&nbsp; Among the stars of the dramatic firmament he
revolved in an amity now and then disturbed by some notice less
fulsome than the object of it may have deemed acceptable.&nbsp;
But on the whole the terms existing in my time between Press and
Stage were those of immense consideration each for each.&nbsp;
That the love of each for each has grown more ardent in these
later days may be attributable to the prodigious increase in the
advertising orders received by newspaper managers from the
managers of playhouses.&nbsp; Painters were less amenable.&nbsp;
Them you had to meet socially.&nbsp; They had the least possible
respect for the professional journalist&rsquo;s opinion of
pictures.&nbsp; They affected to ignore newspaper criticism of
their exhibited works, or, if they were thrust upon them,
shuddered as they read.&nbsp; Artists in black-and-white found
their way to Fleet Street, but their dealings were confined to
the illustrated papers.&nbsp; The first time that a drawing
appeared in a daily paper was, if I remember rightly, when the
<i>Daily Telegraph</i> published what it called &ldquo;a portrait
sketch&rdquo; of Lefroy the murderer, a publication which led, it
may be remembered, to the arrest of that miscreant.&nbsp; To-day
the black-and-white artist is in the ascendant, and I entertain a
pious hope that the day is not far off when its critics will
habitually say of a newspaper, not that it is well or ill
&ldquo;written,&rdquo; but that it is well or ill
&ldquo;drawn.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>This
book will be largely anecdotal.&nbsp; I may therefore be
permitted at this point&mdash;irrelevantly and
parenthetically&mdash;to introduce a reminiscence of Oscar Wilde
which the mention of Lefroy recalls to me; I might forget it
later.&nbsp; I was sitting at Romano&rsquo;s in the company of
that clever and ill-fated genius shortly after the trial of
Lefroy.&nbsp; Wilde was amusing the company with his affectations
and paradoxes.&nbsp; &ldquo;If,&rdquo; he said, in his ineffably
superior way&mdash;&ldquo;if I were not a poet, and could not be
an artist, I should wish to be a murderer.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed one of us, &ldquo;and have your
portrait-sketch in the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Better that,&rdquo; cooed Wilde, &ldquo;than to go down to
the sunless grave unknown.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the same occasion the
merits of Irving&mdash;then attracting the town&mdash;came up for
discussion.&nbsp; Wilde was a warm supporter of the actor&rsquo;s
methods, and indulged in a strain of exaggerated praise over the
performance then holding the boards at the Lyceum.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But what about his legs?&rdquo; inquired an irreverent
listener.&nbsp; &ldquo;Irving&rsquo;s legs,&rdquo; answered
Wilde, with the manner of a man who is promulgating some eternal
truth&mdash;&ldquo;Irving&rsquo;s legs are distinctly precious,
<i>but his left leg is a poem</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having permitted myself this moment of &ldquo;comic
relief,&rdquo; I proceed to state the plan which I propose to
follow in the following pages.&nbsp; I disclaim any title to the
office of auto-biographer.&nbsp; I am nobody.&nbsp; My own twenty
years&rsquo; experience is nothing.&nbsp; The interest of my
reminiscences centres entirely in those others among whom my lot
was cast.&nbsp; So, having in the three following chapters
described the stages over which I drifted into journalism, I
shall in the succeeding chapters abandon any chronological
arrangement of narrative, and group in each section certain
events, individuals, enterprises, and incidents.&nbsp; And the
interest I hope to enhance by the introduction of incidents and
anecdotes that have come under my personal observation and been
uttered in my own hearing.</p>
<p>As I essay to challenge my memory of that pleasant past, the
first results are not satisfactory.&nbsp; The pictures are
confused in composition and blurred in general effect.&nbsp;
After a little patient waiting&mdash;much in the manner of our
late friend <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>Stead in Julia&rsquo;s bureau&mdash;the blurred pictures
acquire other characteristics.&nbsp; The second effect is
kaleidoscopic.&nbsp; The retrospect is full of movement and
colour.&nbsp; At last the kaleidoscopic effects become mere
atmosphere, and one by one, or in groups, the <i>dramatis
person&aelig;</i> take their places on the stage.&nbsp; And the
curtain rises on the play.</p>

18</span>CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="GutSmall">DRIFTING INTO IT</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Nowadays</span>, I understand, there are
schools to educate young gentlemen for the Press.&nbsp; Indeed,
in my own time a school of journalism was founded by a man who
had taken to the calling quite late in life.&nbsp; But I have
never heard that the seminary in question turned out any pressman
of eminence or even of uncommon aptitude.&nbsp; The founder of
the singular academy was a Mr. David Anderson, about whom and
about whose school I may have something to say in another
chapter.</p>
<p>A man of very different calibre, a profound literary scholar,
the most cultured critic of his time, was, at a more recent
period, imbued with Anderson&rsquo;s idea that a special training
was desirable in the case of candidates for a vacancy on a
newspaper staff.&nbsp; He was, indeed, prepared to carry the
notion much farther than the system of perfunctory instruction
instituted by the founder of the &ldquo;school,&rdquo; who was
more or less a blind leader of the blind.&nbsp; The second
reformer to whom I allude contemplated the establishment of a
Chair of Journalism at the University of Birmingham.&nbsp;
Indeed, he had obtained considerable support for his enterprise,
and had it not been for his lamented death, I believe, the scheme
would have taken shape.&nbsp; I had several opportunities of
discussing the proposal with Professor Churton Collins&mdash;for
it is of that accomplished critic and enthusiastic educationist I
am speaking&mdash;and, although it was difficult to withstand
arguments conveyed in the Professor&rsquo;s felicitous language,
and uttered in his melodious and persuasive tones, I was never
quite convinced of the <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>utility of the scheme.&nbsp; From
whence are the Professors to be drawn?&nbsp; Not from the ranks
of journalism, surely.&nbsp; Because the men who have risen to
such an eminence in journalism as would qualify them for the
position would be very unlikely to abandon their fat editorships
for the poor emoluments of such a Chair.</p>
<p>Churton Collins was a man with a passion for accuracy.&nbsp;
His whole teaching was a protest against the slipshod style in
literature.&nbsp; His favourite epithet was
&ldquo;charlatan,&rdquo; which he hurled against all incompetent
persons professing to instruct the public.&nbsp; Moreover, though
in the earlier stages of his career he wrote for newspapers, he
was never what was known as &ldquo;a newspaper man.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He was <i>on</i> the Press, but not <i>of</i> it.&nbsp; And I
question if he had taken much notice of its later
developments.&nbsp; Had he observed the signs of the times as
they are seen in our daily broadsheets, he would have perhaps
admitted that among the qualifications which should be demanded
in any occupant of a University Chair of Journalism was a good
working knowledge of the camera, and the ability to instruct
students in the most suitable subjects for photographic
reproduction.</p>
<p>Schools of journalism and professorships of Press lore are
&ldquo;all my eye and Betty Martin.&rdquo;&nbsp; The journalist,
like the poet, is born, not made.&nbsp; A University education
can do him no harm.&nbsp; A large proportion of the men of the
seventies and eighties had had a distinguished University
career.&nbsp; Nor does the absence of a college education
prejudice the aspiring neophyte.&nbsp; Those men, indeed, who
have made themselves a name in journalism&mdash;such men, for
instance, as George Sala and Archibald Forbes&mdash;started
without any of the equipment supplied by an Alma Mater.&nbsp; Any
training worth mentioning must be picked up on the Press
itself.&nbsp; And the main qualification is a natural
aptitude.&nbsp; Thus, the journalist&mdash;self-taught man, or
public-school man, or University man&mdash;just drifts into
it.</p>
<p>Personally I have to admit that it was in my own case entirely
a matter of drifting.&nbsp; Unconsciously and gently impelled
toward it by the motions of a certain desire for facile and
frequent expression in print, one becomes eventually <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>the subject
of an invincible attraction.&nbsp; Those who were responsible for
the ordering of my early life took a large view of their
responsibilities.&nbsp; The same persons who had provided me with
a rattle and a cradle, in later years selected for me a
profession.&nbsp; And although I have never ceased to be a member
of the learned profession chosen for me, in the same way that I
abandoned the rattle and the perambulator, it has never afforded
me either the amusement or the support supplied by the toys or
the equipages of childhood.&nbsp; I am indebted to it, however,
for some cherished friendships, and for introductions to some
valuable &ldquo;openings&rdquo; into that teeming journalistic
arena with which I was to become identified.&nbsp; Those set in
authority over me believed that I was &ldquo;cut out&rdquo; for a
barrister.&nbsp; But when I, my friends, was called to the Bar,
I&rsquo;d an appetite&mdash;well, for anything but law.&nbsp; The
law never appealed to me.&nbsp; Literature always did.&nbsp;
Before I went into chambers&mdash;and for some time after
that&mdash;the only interest the Temple possessed for me was that
Goldsmith lay buried there, and that there Warrington and
Pendennis railed against the publishers, and wrote for the
<i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, thus antedating by many years the
actual appearance of that journal.&nbsp; While reading for the
Bar and keeping my terms, I had few acquaintances in London
beyond those I met at the dinners in Hall, and Mr. MacDermott,
with whom I &ldquo;read.&rdquo;&nbsp; The town seemed deadly
lonely at first.&nbsp; It takes some time before the new-comer
realizes that he is part of the crowd that jostles him, before
the feeling of isolation gives way to that of fellowship.</p>
<p>When I first came up, I lodged at the house of an old
gentleman in Woburn Place, Russell Square.&nbsp; He was a typical
Londoner, and he followed a calling of which, I should imagine,
he must have been the very last professor.&nbsp; He was a painter
of hatchments.&nbsp; In those days the death of a member of the
aristocracy was indicated by the appearance on the house-front of
a canvas bearing a representation of the armorial bearings of the
deceased.&nbsp; This work of art was usually fixed between the
windows of the first-floor.&nbsp; These grim heraldic
emblazonments were at one time <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>exhibited in considerable profusion
in the streets and squares of the West End.&nbsp; The custom
seems to have &ldquo;gone out.&rdquo;&nbsp; So many swells now
live in flats, where the exhibition of such mural decoration
might be misunderstood and resented, that the grisly custom has
grown into desuetude.&nbsp; My landlord was the last of the
hatchment painters.&nbsp; He was a little man close upon seventy
years of age.&nbsp; He was extremely good-looking, had small
side-whiskers and a tiny imperial, both snow-white.&nbsp; The
rest of his face was clean-chaven.&nbsp; His salient physical
peculiarity was a pink and white complexion which have been the
despair and envy of his aristocratic patrons.&nbsp; He was a
brisk, cheery mortal wonderfully quick in his movements.&nbsp;
For the rest, he loved the London in which he had been born, and
from which he had never wandered much farther than Hampton Court;
he had a fund of information about the houses of Mayfair and
Bloomsbury; he was a determined playgoer; he had an
acquaintanceship with some actors and actresses, and was on
particularly friendly terms with Charles Mathews.&nbsp;
Naturally, he was a wellspring of gossip regarding the noble
families with whom his melancholy art made him acquainted.</p>
<p>His studio was in Great Ormond Street, and next door to the
Working Men&rsquo;s College, where he had got to know the Rev. F.
D. Maurice and the Rev. Charles Kingsley.&nbsp; Of the latter
broad-minded Broad Churchman he had several stories.&nbsp; One
only can I recall.&nbsp; Kingsley had felt called upon to reprove
a parishioner of his on a growing spirit of miserliness which he
was exhibiting.&nbsp; The fellow was well off, a widower, and
living alone.&nbsp; He was denying himself the necessaries of
life, when his Rector thought it time to remonstrate.&nbsp; But
the old man was immune against reason, or, rather, he had an
objection to every argument urged by his spiritual adviser.&nbsp;
At last Kingsley took him on lower ground.&nbsp; The old fellow
had an only son.&nbsp; He was a sailor and a notoriously
free-handed young man.&nbsp; &ldquo;This money,&rdquo; urged the
Rector, &ldquo;which you are hoarding, and which you might employ
so usefully, will come at last to your boy, who will fling it <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>about with
both hands.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; observed the
unrepentant niggard, &ldquo;if Jim has on&rsquo;y half the
pleasure a-spendin&rsquo; on it as I&rsquo;ve had a-savin&rsquo;
on it, I wholly envy &rsquo;im&mdash;that &rsquo;a
do.&rdquo;&nbsp; A congregation composed of rustics of that type
must have been a bit of a trial to a man of Kingsley&rsquo;s
optimistic temperament.&nbsp; But, then, his reverence was also
endowed with the saving grace of humour.</p>
<p>I suppose the hatchment habit&mdash;which had persisted for so
many generations&mdash;had fallen into a rapid decline just about
this period, for my cheery little landlord had but lately taken
to letting apartments.&nbsp; The income from heraldic painting
had ceased to prove sufficient for the upkeep of a big
house.&nbsp; The old gentleman&rsquo;s housekeepers were a wife
and daughter, whose second-hand acquaintance with the heraldry of
the great had induced the belief that, if not actually &ldquo;in
Society,&rdquo; they were very much in touch with it.&nbsp; Their
conversation was studded with allusions to &ldquo;Lady
This&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lord That.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was some time
before I discovered that their constant conversational appeals to
&ldquo;the Dook,&rdquo; a personage with whom, it might appear,
they lived on terms of considerable intimacy, was His Grace the
Duke of Bedford.&nbsp; Their supposed friendship with that
nobleman rested solely on the circumstance that His Grace was the
ground landlord of the premises in which they lived.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I shall certainly speak to the Dook about it,&rdquo; or,
&ldquo;You must reelly write to His Grace, my dear,&rdquo; were
tit-bits that were served up to me <i>ad nauseam</i>
when&mdash;as would sometimes be the case&mdash;I was asked to
join the ladies at five o&rsquo;clock tea.&nbsp; In his
reminiscences of &ldquo;the nobs,&rdquo; as the Upper Ten were
then called, the hatchment painter himself betrayed no
snobbishness whatever.&nbsp; He related anecdotes of his noble
employers, just as he would tell a &ldquo;good thing&rdquo; about
a divine, or an actor, or an artist.</p>
<p>And talking of artists, I may mention here that the only
person of distinction whose acquaintance I ever made through my
host was Frost, the accomplished follower of Etty as a painter of
the nude.&nbsp; I had the mild, man-in-the-street sort of
admiration of Frost&rsquo;s work, which I had seen on the walls
of the Royal Academy Exhibition, <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>then held, not at Burlington House,
but in Trafalgar Square.&nbsp; And from his pictures I
expected&mdash;such are the perverse preconceptions of
youth&mdash;to meet a young, tall, flamboyant man with flowing
locks and the airs of a Grand Seignior.&nbsp; We were walking one
morning&mdash;my host and I&mdash;down the main avenue of the
Regent&rsquo;s Park.&nbsp; It was spring-time.&nbsp; The
flower-beds were ablaze with bulb plants.&nbsp; But few people
were about at the moment.&nbsp; Presently we came upon a small
and sombre man feeding the sparrows, which followed him in
flocks, hovering about his head, and now and then lighting on his
hand to snatch a crumb.&nbsp; The small, sombre man was dressed
in rusty broadcloth.&nbsp; He wore a wig, had a most melancholy
expression, and might have been put down as a superannuated
tax-collector, a solicitor run to seed, a Dissenting preacher out
of work; but not one man in a thousand would have identified him
as a painter of nude subjects, which had been severely reprobated
by the unco&rsquo; guid.&nbsp; Yet the amiable provider of food
for the sparrows was none other than the celebrated Mr.
Frost.&nbsp; Frost was a bachelor, and his house was kept for him
by a couple of old maiden sisters, who had little sympathy with
the direction in art which their brother&rsquo;s genius had
taken.&nbsp; But the sparrows in Regent&rsquo;s Park altogether
approved of their eccentric benefactor.&nbsp; And in this
particular form of charity he was the forerunner of the amiable
M. Pol (that is the Frenchman&rsquo;s name, I think) whom I have
watched feeding the birds in the gardens of the Tuileries.&nbsp;
On this occasion Frost was not to be tempted into any discussion
on art.&nbsp; He was intent on arguing the question of drains
with my friend, and spoke on the sewer question with the dry
particularity of a sanitary engineer.&nbsp; Altogether a
disappointing experience of the painter of &ldquo;Actea: the
Nymph of the Shore,&rdquo; a work which had stimulated all my
youthful enthusiasm.</p>
<p>The first movement in the drifting stage of my career was the
result of my presence at the first performance of
&ldquo;School&rdquo; at the old Prince of Wales Theatre in
Tottenham Street.&nbsp; The hatchment painter and I had long
before agreed that we would be present on that memorable
occasion.&nbsp; <a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>The night came at last.&nbsp; We were early&mdash;or
what in those days would have been considered early&mdash;and
obtained seats at the back of the pit.&nbsp; At that time the
suburbs still remained sane.&nbsp; There was no queue of demented
women posted outside pit and gallery doors at eight o&rsquo;clock
in the morning so as to be in good time for a performance
commencing at eight at night.&nbsp; But the seating capacity of
Miss Wilton&rsquo;s theatre was limited, the pittites being
restricted to a very small area, and, having passed the
check-taker, we felt that we might consider ourselves lucky in
having gained admittance at all.&nbsp; Ah, to recall the
sensations of that playgoing!&nbsp; The sigh of relief as I
settle myself in my seat!&nbsp; The roseate air of pleasurable
anticipation on the faces of those about me; the empty rows of
the booked stalls stretching from the front row of the pit to the
orchestra; the eager scanning of the features of the stalls as
they file in; the curious feeling of cheery elation, of high
expectation&mdash;these are sensations which grow very stale with
use; they are the prerogatives of youth.&nbsp; Enjoy them, my
boys, while you are in your heyday.&nbsp; They are moods for
which the old and the <i>blas&eacute;</i> would give a ransom to
experience once again.</p>
<p>Indirectly and ultimately this visit to the pit meant much to
me.&nbsp; Immediately it meant my first appearance in print in a
London publication; eventually it meant my first acquaintance
with a dramatic author.&nbsp; Ultimately, perhaps, it meant the
determination to a calling quite apart from that to which I had
been devoted by my friends.&nbsp; My chirpy companion, as he kept
pointing out to me the various distinguished stall-holders as
they filed into their places, little dreamed&mdash;as, indeed,
how should he?&mdash;that he was conversing with a dramatic
critic <i>in embryo</i>, and that in the course of a few short
years I, too, would have a stall set apart for me in that select
parterre.</p>
<p>With the production of &ldquo;School&rdquo; the Bancroft
management and the Robertson comedies reached high-water mark,
and all the town was soon rushing to the Royal Dustbin in its
grimy and shabby little street off the Tottenham Court
Road.&nbsp; A return to the natural in comedy has always <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>spelled
success.&nbsp; Farquhar&rsquo;s was such a return.&nbsp;
Goldsmith&rsquo;s return to nature was hailed by a community sick
of stilted heroics and artificial sentiment.&nbsp; Sheridan later
on recalled the playgoer to the fact that to give a humorous
presentation of society as it is means the highest pleasure to
the patron and the highest profit to the playwright.&nbsp; At
this present time of writing a return to nature has a meaning
very different indeed to that which it bore at other
periods.&nbsp; Nowadays the meaning of a return to nature seems
to be a return to obscenity.&nbsp; Natural is a term connoting
lubricity.&nbsp; And to this confusion in the minds of some
modern dramatists as to the true significance of words I
attribute much of the irritation caused by supervision and most
of the agitation fomented with a view of disestablishing the
censorship.&nbsp; But in the old Tottenham Street days we had not
as yet accepted the quaint perversion of ideas at present offered
us by an an&aelig;mic, exotic, futile section of playwrights,
whose goods are exhibited at unlicensed matin&eacute;es,
because&mdash;luckily&mdash;the managers see &ldquo;no
money&rdquo; in them.&nbsp; The word &ldquo;nature&rdquo; was not
understood in this foul fashion by T. W. Robertson.&nbsp; The men
and women of Robertson&rsquo;s comedies were the men and women of
his own day.&nbsp; The incidents were amusing without being
preposterous, or pathetic without being maudlin.&nbsp; The
construction of the Robertson series was close, intelligible,
sequent.&nbsp; His dialogue rippled rather than sparkled; the
story was invariably simple, wholesome, attractive; and over each
production was the incommunicable Robertson atmosphere.</p>
<p>And the management that presented these dainty works exercised
a care, a taste, and a scrupulous devotion to the details of
representation which came as a revelation to those acquainted
with the stage methods of the period; and marked, indeed, a
revolution in stage management.&nbsp; It is not overstating the
case to say that, had it not been for the lead given in this
direction by the Bancrofts in the &rsquo;sixties and early
&rsquo;seventies, and subsequently followed up with still greater
<i>&eacute;clat</i> by the same artists at the Haymarket, one
would scarcely have witnessed the elaborate sets and costly casts
to which Irving accustomed us in the &rsquo;eighties and <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>&rsquo;nineties, or on which, in our own time, Sir
Herbert Tree spends so much money and so much intelligent
enterprise.&nbsp; In the history of stage reform, however, the
Bancrofts must always figure as pioneers; nor is anyone who is
old enough to remember the London stage as it was accepted before
their management of the Prince of Wales Theatre, at all likely to
controvert the statement.&nbsp; Happily for the public, the lead
was quickly and largely followed.&nbsp; The old-fashioned
stage-manager became a thing of the past.&nbsp; What was once the
exception is now the rule.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Most can raise
the flowers now,<br />
For all have got the seed.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Slender as was my experience of London theatres and immature
as was my judgment, I was intelligently impressed by the idyllic
delicacy of the work represented, and by the exquisite rendering
accorded by a company so wonderfully fitted with their
parts.&nbsp; I confess to having felt an enthusiasm then which
now I should have some difficulty in explaining.&nbsp; That
emotion was soon to find an opportunity for expression.&nbsp;
When &ldquo;School&rdquo; had been running for some little time,
a letter appeared in the <i>Times</i>, conceived in that spirit
of dignified rebuke which, in its correspondents, seems to have
appealed to successive editors of that great newspaper.&nbsp; In
this communication Robertson was crudely accused of having stolen
the play, lock, stock, and barrel, from a play then (or recently)
running in Germany.&nbsp; I had no acquaintance with the German
language and no time (so insistent on protest was my indignation)
to inquire into the facts.&nbsp; But I felt that from the
internal evidence afforded by &ldquo;School&rdquo; I would be
able to make a good case.&nbsp; Even in those remote days many of
our most admired articles of so-called British manufacture were
&ldquo;made in Germany,&rdquo; and most of them bore about with
them the ineffaceable signs of their origin.&nbsp; I strongly
felt that on internal evidence I should have little difficulty,
in that &ldquo;School&rdquo; was &ldquo;quite English, you
know,&rdquo; and that, above all, there was no trace whatever of
anything German in the conception or the treatment.&nbsp; I had
already seen the play a second <a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>time when the <i>Times</i> letter
made its appearance.&nbsp; On the night of the day on which it
was published I paid a third visit to the pit of the Tottenham
Street playhouse.&nbsp; When I got back to my
&ldquo;diggings,&rdquo; I sat down and commenced to write what I
intended to be a letter to Jupiter Tonans of Printing House
Square, but what turned out to be my first professional
contribution to the London Press.&nbsp; Next day I abandoned my
more legitimate studies, and rewrote and polished&mdash;as well
as I knew how&mdash;the essay over which I had burned my first
sacrifice of midnight oil.&nbsp; The result was in no way
suitable as a letter in the correspondence column of a
newspaper.&nbsp; My own poor outlook assured me of that.&nbsp;
Where to send the essay?&nbsp; A copy of a weekly magazine called
<i>Once a Week</i> lay on a chair in the room.&nbsp; I caught it
up, looked for the editorial address, wrote a brief note to the
editor apprising him of the drift of my contribution, addressed
an envelope, and posted my &ldquo;stuff,&rdquo; as I subsequently
learned to call my articles in manuscript.</p>
<p>Had a mentor, skilled to advise, been available at that
moment, he would no doubt have advised me to send my essay to any
other publication, but <i>not</i> to <i>Once a Week</i>, because
the paper in question was then under the editorial control of a
member of the staff of the <i>Times</i>.&nbsp; So that&mdash;a
circumstance of which I was happily ignorant&mdash;the organ
selected haphazard for my venture was the very last that should
be likely to serve my purpose.&nbsp; Four days after its despatch
I received a proof of the article with a request that it should
be &ldquo;returned immediately&rdquo; to the printer.&nbsp; A
delightful sensation&mdash;that of correcting one&rsquo;s first
galleys of matter moist from the press!&nbsp; The following week
the article appeared in all the pride of print, though I confess
that the pride of print (a mere figurative locution) was as
nothing to the pride of the author who already saw himself on the
high-road to fame and fortune.&nbsp; Alas! it is a highroad
which, while the gayest and cheeriest to travel, rarely leads to
fame, and never to fortune. . . . I have no doubt that this first
published composition of mine was a tremendously faulty piece of
work&mdash;immature and pretentious.&nbsp; But the appearance of
no subsequent production of mine <a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>has afforded me a tithe of the
pleasure.&nbsp; And, incidentally, it was the means of my making
the acquaintance of &ldquo;Tom&rdquo; Robertson.</p>
<p>Our acquaintanceship&mdash;never an intimate one&mdash;began
with a correspondence, friendly and genial on his side, ebullient
and unctuous, I fear, on mine, for I was very young.&nbsp; Some
time elapsed before I met him in the flesh.&nbsp; The
introduction was effected at the Albion Tavern in Russell Street,
Covent Garden.&nbsp; That famous hostelry has gone by the board
this many a day.&nbsp; When first I knew it the Albion was a
London institution for which one might have prophesied a
permanence as secure as that of St. Paul&rsquo;s.&nbsp; It faced
the north side wall of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, some
distance west of the stage-door.&nbsp; It was the favourite
supper resort of theatrical people, and famous for its tripe and
onions and for its marrow-bones.&nbsp; An excellent dinner of
fish, joint, and cheese was served earlier in the evening at half
a crown a head&mdash;the carver, in white smock and apron and
white cook&rsquo;s cap, wheeling the joint round from table to
table on an ambulatory dumb-waiter, and carving in front of the
customer, and according to the customer&rsquo;s desire.&nbsp; The
place was run by two brothers, named Cooper, who owned a similar
house in Fleet Street.&nbsp; This was called the Rainbow.&nbsp;
It was a great luncheon-resort of lawyers, and three-fourths of
the present occupants of the judicial bench must have taken their
midday meal there from time to time.&nbsp; The Rainbow, alas!
where once law officers chopped and learned leaders absorbed the
midday refresher, is now mainly a wine-bar&mdash;the daily resort
of the Guppys, the Joblings, and the Smallweeds of the
profession.</p>
<p>The brothers Cooper were not very much in evidence at either
house.&nbsp; They presented none of the characteristics of the
typical licensed victualler.&nbsp; Indeed, they were the most
highly respectable looking men to be seen in any walk of
life&mdash;rosy-cheeked, white-whiskered, of solemnly benign
expression, and dressed with an amount of elderly foppishness
which, in a drab mid-Victorian age, was quite delightful to
behold.&nbsp; Up the Thames&mdash;somewhere in the Hampton <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>Court
direction, if I remember aright&mdash;where their home was, the
neighbours who were &ldquo;not in the know&rdquo; supposed them
to be stockbrokers of a sporting turn of mind.&nbsp; But if the
Coopers took no ostensibly active part in the management of the
Albion, they were most effectively represented by their
head-waiter&mdash;the incomparable Paunceford.&nbsp; Even now,
across the years, one can see his beaming face, his head held a
little to one side&mdash;a propitiatory pose&mdash;his twinkling
eye, his mellifluous and insinuating tone as he proceeds from box
to box, half an hour, or even an hour, after closing-time, with
the half-plaintive, half-humorous admonition of &ldquo;Time,
gentlemen, if you please!&rdquo;&nbsp; Paunceford and the Albion
should both have been made immortal.&nbsp; For when the Albion
closed its doors, another race of waiters had arisen, and
Paunceford&rsquo;s occupation was gone.&nbsp; The last time I
passed through Russell Street, Covent Garden, a merchant from the
neighbouring market was running the premises as a store for fruit
and vegetables.&nbsp; I wonder whether the ghosts of those
departed who once made merry within ever appear to the eminent
salesman, flitting behind his mountains of green-stuff, or
playing phantom hide-and-seek among his boxes of oranges and
bananas.</p>
<p>The first meeting between Robertson and myself was cordial
enough, but though he evidently appreciated the defence of
&ldquo;School,&rdquo; which was the basis of our friendship, it
was equally apparent that he had expected to meet an older man,
and one who was at least somewhere &ldquo;in the
movement.&rdquo;&nbsp; When at last we were alone, he became
communicative.&nbsp; He was at the time probably suffering from
the premonitory distresses of the disease which was destined to
carry him off untimely.&nbsp; My first impression was of the
bitterness with which he discussed men and things.&nbsp; It was
so entirely different from that which I had expected in the mood
of one who stood so illuminated in the sunlight of popular
approval.&nbsp; Fame and competence had come too late for
him.&nbsp; The long, hungry struggle for recognition had soured a
nature once, perhaps, sunny enough.&nbsp; More than once during
our conversation he alluded to his troubles with his first
success, &ldquo;Society.&rdquo;&nbsp; It had originally been <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>intended for
Buckstone at the Haymarket&mdash;then <i>par excellence</i> the
Comedy theatre; and for six years after its refusal by Buckstone
its author had hawked it about to all the London managers and to
some in the provinces.&nbsp; I had asked him what chance of
recognition a beginner at stage-writing should have with the
managers.&nbsp; This it was that brought &ldquo;Society&rdquo; on
the tapis.&nbsp; He drove home the lesson with the <i>argumentum
ad hominem</i>.&nbsp; His deliverance certainly put me off any
vague scheme I may have formed of commencing dramatist, and made
me resolve to advance in the critical career upon which, in my
youthful folly, I imagined I had successfully embarked.&nbsp;
Speaking with great acerbity, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was born among stage associations.&nbsp; I grew up
among them.&nbsp; It was the natural thing for me to look to the
stage for my daily bread.&nbsp; My earliest craft was
stagecraft.&nbsp; If I was compelled to carry about in my
back-pocket for six years the play into which I had put all my
experience before I could get a hearing, you can calculate for
yourself the chances of an outsider.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reverting to the charge of having drawn on the work of others
for his most popular success, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The author of a successful play is always charged with
plagiarism.&nbsp; It was a commonplace to accuse Sheridan of the
crime.&nbsp; And Shakespeare was&mdash;according to the
critics&mdash;the greatest thief of all.&nbsp; I am, at least,
pilloried in good company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a pause, he continued, with increased bitterness:</p>
<p>&ldquo;According to your critic, the only man who never
plagiarizes is the dramatist who is hidebound by tradition; whose
work reeks of the essence of authors who have gone before him, or
who are his contemporaries.&nbsp; The only originality they know
of is originality of phrase.&nbsp; Original dramatists of the
sort generally find time to do a little dramatic criticism as
well, so that their case runs no danger of being understated on
the press.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could not help reflecting at the time that of all men T. W.
Robertson had least reason to complain of the indifference or the
ineptitude of the dramatic critics.&nbsp; Altogether <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>my sentiment
on bidding Robertson &ldquo;Good-night&rdquo; was one of
depression, which quite overbalanced that feeling of elation
which a raw and callow youth would naturally experience after
having enjoyed a couple of hours intimate and uninterrupted chat
with the most popular dramatist of the hour.</p>
<p>William Brunton&mdash;that most lovable and luckless of
Irishmen and artists&mdash;had given me the coveted personal
introduction.&nbsp; Him I had met at the hatchment studio in
Great Ormond Street.&nbsp; Brunton was himself a dabbler in
heraldry, and, before he started as a comic artist on the pages
of Tom Hood&rsquo;s <i>Fun</i>, had been something of an
authority on family escutcheons.&nbsp; A handsome,
distinguished-looking fellow was Brunton in those days.&nbsp; His
laugh was contagious, and greeted impartially his own jokes and
those of his friends.&nbsp; His own jokes were curious, involved,
impromptus, mostly without meaning, but characterized by an
irresistible quaintness of manner.&nbsp; His own hearty enjoyment
of these cryptic <i>morceaux</i> made up for any lack of
substance in the things themselves, and, by a sort of infection,
aroused the laughter of his hearers.&nbsp; Thus I have myself
roared with merriment over his report of the ultimatum delivered
by the Irish widow on a third-floor-back in Clare Market to her
countrywoman occupying the third-floor-front.&nbsp; It was the
way he did it, for in cold print the joke scarcely moves even the
most facile muscles:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I declare to Hiven, Mrs. Dooley ma&rsquo;am, if ye
don&rsquo;t take yer washin&rsquo; off the lobby, I&rsquo;ll quit
th&rsquo; tinimint!&nbsp; There it is shmokin&rsquo; like a
lime-kiln, and my dog Towzer barkin&rsquo; at it, thinkin&rsquo;
it&rsquo;s a robber!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Brunton heard of my appearance for the defence of
Robertson in the matter of &ldquo;School,&rdquo; and became
acquainted with my desire to be introduced, he at once promised,
in his jovial, off-hand manner, to bring about the accomplishment
of my wish.&nbsp; That he faithfully fulfilled his undertaking
has been seen.&nbsp; I met Brunton shortly after at the Strand
Theatre.&nbsp; I confessed to him that Robertson&rsquo;s
conversation had not exhilarated me, and that <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>I had not
been prepared for a mood so pessimistic in a man so
fortunate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; declared Brunton
cheerily.&nbsp; &ldquo;You should hear Tom sometimes.&nbsp; Last
night he was denyin&rsquo; th&rsquo; existence of th&rsquo;
Almighty.&nbsp; Dr. Barnett, the editor of the <i>Sunday
Times</i>, was present.&nbsp; B&mdash; was at one time a
Dissenting divine, you know, and is as orthodox as the Pope of
Rome.&nbsp; He gently rebuked Tom.&nbsp; It was only addin&rsquo;
fuel to the flame.&nbsp; &lsquo;If there be a God, why
don&rsquo;t He destroy me now?&rsquo; says Tom.&nbsp; Then it was
old Barnett&rsquo;s turn.&nbsp; With a sweet smile and the soft
accent of a sort of evangelical angel, he answered: &lsquo;You
forget, Tom, that the Almighty is capable of an infinite
contempt!&rsquo;&nbsp; And be jabers,&rdquo; concluded Brunton,
&ldquo;poor Robertson was as dumb as an oyster for the rest of
the evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a noble retort, and it is pleasant to know that
Robertson accepted it in silence, and subsequently expressed a
very pretty contrition.&nbsp; Robertson was the first experience
I had of the fact that an author&rsquo;s personality or
temperament can rarely be gathered from his works.&nbsp; During
my sojourn in the tents of Shem I was destined to meet many
famous illustrations of the same truth.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">LEARNING TO SWIM</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> receipt of a cheque in payment
for the Robertson article in <i>Once a Week</i> convinced me, not
only that I had discovered my <i>m&eacute;tier</i>, but that I
had formally entered upon a profitable occupation, which would be
pursued under most agreeable conditions.&nbsp; Let me at once
confess that some years were to elapse before the returns from my
literary labours amounted to a sum that would pay for my tobacco
and my laundry.&nbsp; But if in the period of keeping my terms
cheques were few and far between, I got no end of an opportunity
of seeing my name in print as the author of at least one
prodigious poetical work and of several essays, chiefly of
dramatic criticism.&nbsp; It is pleasant to reflect that these
exercises&mdash;early and immature though they were&mdash;brought
me several friends in the literary and artistic world.&nbsp; At
this juncture, indeed, it appeared probable that I would
eventually develop into a &ldquo;litery gent&rdquo; whose future
outlook would be that of considerable dubiety as to the
respectability of the journalistic calling.</p>
<p>A friendly solicitor&mdash;I had been admonished to make
friends of the Mammon of Unrighteousness&mdash;introduced me at a
City dinner to William Harrison Ainsworth, author of &ldquo;The
Tower of London&rdquo; and other lurid romances.&nbsp; It was a
bit of a surprise to meet the venerable man, for, truth to tell,
I had thought him long since dead.&nbsp; He was by no means dead,
however, or even apparently moribund, but extremely alive to
anything that looked like business.&nbsp; His Manchester training
never failed him to the end.&nbsp; He exhibited a fatherly
interest in me, which was extremely <a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>flattering to my vanity, and before
we parted he had arranged a luncheon date for the following
week.&nbsp; He was living at the time at Hurstpierpoint in
Sussex.&nbsp; I kept the appointment, you may be well assured,
and after our little midday meal the worthy exponent of Dick
Turpin opened his business.</p>
<p>It was a simple affair.&nbsp; He had acquired a magazine some
time before, and, finding that its circulation did not come up to
his expectations, he had resold to a relative&mdash;a cousin of
his own.&nbsp; He had agreed with the sanguine relative that he
would continue to send in signed contributions, and that he would
secure the services of other brilliant writers; and I was one of
the &ldquo;brilliant writers&rdquo; whose exertions were to raise
the cousin&rsquo;s hopeless purchase into a position of
safety.&nbsp; Harrison Ainsworth candidly assured me that the
proprietor was not in a position to pay for the serial rights of
my esteemed contributions.&nbsp; But the copyright should remain
mine&mdash;a valuable concession and consideration!&mdash;and I
should receive suitable remuneration when the magazine
&ldquo;turned the corner.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ah, that fugacious corner
which, always nearing, is rarely reached, and never by any chance
turned!&nbsp; How often has it lured the novice and tempted even
the needy veteran victim!&nbsp; I agreed to all my host&rsquo;s
suggestions.&nbsp; As I left him, he murmured a tremulous
&ldquo;God bless you!&rdquo; and I was conscious of a fine
feeling of elation as I returned to town&mdash;my star evidently
in the ascendant.</p>
<p>If there was no money to be obtained from my new engagement,
there was some fun: there was excellent practice, and there was
the unexpected introduction to a &ldquo;set&rdquo; whose members
I had always admired at a distance, but with whom my taste and
training had denied me an understanding sympathy.&nbsp; For a
while I fluttered in those reserved groves.&nbsp; But when at
last the Street of Adventure claimed me as its own, my new
associates drew me from those higher altitudes.&nbsp; The loss, I
am sure, has all been mine.</p>
<p>On the magazine, to which I had pledged myself, I commenced as
a poet, a poem being the only thing I had by me.&nbsp; The
cousinly proprietor&mdash;an extremely pleasant old <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>gentleman,
also named Ainsworth&mdash;appeared glad to accept
<i>anything</i>.&nbsp; He was the only person whom I have known
literally to laugh over misfortunes.&nbsp; He was a
septuagenarian Mark Tapley.&nbsp; He gave excellent dinners at
Ravenscourt Park&mdash;the house in which he entertained has long
since been reduced to what printers call &ldquo;pie,&rdquo; its
place being covered with brand-new &ldquo;mansions&rdquo; and
&ldquo;gardens&rdquo; and villas.&nbsp; It speaks volumes for the
old gentleman&rsquo;s good-nature that, when my
&ldquo;poem&rdquo; appeared, filling five pages of his
periodical, he never uttered a word of rebuke or reproach.&nbsp;
That was forty years ago, and I still regard the incident with
gratitude, for the composition was a narrative of great
duration.&nbsp; The scene was laid in Italy, the subject
romantic, and the verse written in heroic couplets, interspersed
with lyrics after the manner made fashionable by the Poet
Laureate.&nbsp; I never saw it again after my first rapturous
readings, but I have little doubt that it was sad stuff.</p>
<p>I then resolutely set myself to keep my proprietor fed up with
prose essays.&nbsp; I had the material, and I took no end of
pains with the setting.&nbsp; They were for the most part essays
in literary criticism, and one or two of them attracted the
attention of the right sort of people.&nbsp; Many years after its
appearance, I was surprised and gratified to find one of these
early articles quoted in the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i> by Theodore
Watts-Dunton, and quoted, moreover, by that distinguished man of
letters as being authoritative.&nbsp; Alas! by the time this
appreciation of my literary research and criticism appeared I had
ceased to take myself very seriously, and I was mixing in a
society that did not take <i>anything</i> very seriously.&nbsp;
In my early years I had the run of a good dramatic library,
particularly rich in editions of the Elizabethan masters.&nbsp;
The majority of my essays of this period were derived from those
boyish studies, fortified by later browsings in the reading-room
of the British Museum.&nbsp; The eminent but erratic Irish
gentleman with whom I was reading Law had suggested the Museum,
little imagining the direction which my researches there were
sometimes to take.&nbsp; To which of these fugitive pieces of the
Ainsworthonian <a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>period of my novitiate I owed my introduction to Madox
Brown, the celebrated Pre-Raphaelite painter, I cannot distinctly
recall.&nbsp; Clearly, it would not have been to that terrible
Italian romance in heroic couplets.&nbsp; But the thing happened
somehow, and I still remember the pleasurable sensations I
experienced when Oliver, the son of the great artist, called on
me by appointment and took me round to the house in Fitzroy
Square, to be introduced to his father.&nbsp; Madox Brown was a
handsome man, of medium height, broad-shouldered, with a wiry
beard, at that time just beginning to show the grey autumnal
tints.&nbsp; The charm of the man was to be caught in the sweet
benignity of his expression and in the musical cadences of his
voice.&nbsp; He was evidently the devoted family man.&nbsp; And
it was his interest in his own children that caused him to suffer
the society of other young fellows struggling for notice.&nbsp;
Among those who dropped in at the studio that afternoon were Theo
Marzials, the author of the popular &ldquo;Twickenham
Ferry,&rdquo; and Hueffer, the exponent of Wagner, who was
engaged to Brown&rsquo;s daughter.</p>
<p>A reception to which I received an invitation some weeks after
was my first appearance in one of the select literary circles of
the capital.&nbsp; It was in honour of Hueffer and his
bride-to-be, and was held at the Madox Brown house in Fitzroy
Square on the night before the wedding.&nbsp; It was a rather
weird experience.&nbsp; And not even the fact that Swinburne was
present&mdash;and his was a figure to arouse all my youthful
enthusiasm&mdash;reconciled me to the gathering.&nbsp; I felt as
much alone in this crowd as I had formerly felt in the seething
streets.&nbsp; I beat an early retreat, profoundly impressed by
the reflection that I did not possess the natural adaptability
which would make me an acceptable member of a society with its
own especial equipment, its own passwords, and its own particular
pose.&nbsp; I should never have become a competent authority on
that which Carlyle calls &ldquo;the Correggiosity of
Correggio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Madox Brown connection led to an invitation to Westland
Marston&rsquo;s less &ldquo;precious&rdquo; Sunday receptions,
and to those of Lady Duffus Hardy.&nbsp; At the latter house I <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>met for the
first time Joaquin Millar, the poet of the Sierras.&nbsp; Millar
and I were to become great friends later on, but on first meeting
him my feeling was one of frank dislike.&nbsp; At the time his
pose was that of the wild man of the illimitable plains.&nbsp; He
kept his hair in curling cataracts down his shoulders.&nbsp; He
wore great jack-boots over his trousers, and was accustomed to
appear in the Park mounted on a hack harnessed with a Mexican
saddle, blinkers, and other absurd accoutrements.&nbsp; The rider
wore a white sombrero, and gilt spurs six inches long.&nbsp; If
his object was to attract attention, he undoubtedly
succeeded.&nbsp; In the drawing-room of the Hardys he struck the
sublimest attitudes, and, when he crossed the room, did it with a
limp&mdash;because he had heard that Byron limped.</p>
<p>His utterances were studied with a view of occasioning
surprise.&nbsp; He had then lately returned from a tour in
Italy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What struck you most about Venice?&rdquo; inquired one
of his fair admirers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bugs!&rdquo; he replied with entire gravity, and
stroking his golden beard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Millar!&rdquo; exclaimed the lady, in shocked
reproof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he proceeded calmly, &ldquo;the bugs in
Venice are not the mild domestic animals you cultivate in this
country.&nbsp; A Venetian bug has a beard and moustache as big as
the King of Italy&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was during this stay in England that Millar met a lady to
whom he became engaged, and the poet would have married her had
her parents not discovered in time that the wild man of the
illimitable plains had already a wife and child stranded
somewhere on the South Pacific Coast.</p>
<p>Joaquin Millar became in time quite a civilized Christian, and
I reflect, with some natural satisfaction, that I was the humble
means in the hands of Providence that, some years after our first
frigid meeting, succeeded in inducing him to get his hair
cut.&nbsp; An immense social and moral rehabilitation followed
this sacrifice on the part of a poet who had his share of the
Divine afflatus.&nbsp; What he lost in picturesqueness he gained
in self-respect, and during his brief sojourns in <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>London he
figured as a Bohemian observant of the conventions, and possessed
of a certain subtle humour, which rendered his society very
agreeable to his club mates at the Savage.</p>
<p>The travelling American millionaire is a strange portent in
his way; but to me a far more wonderful thing is the American who
on a small and irregular pay, often derived from correspondence
with some third-rate newspaper, supplemented by the proceeds of a
few magazine articles, manages to travel all over the habitable
globe.&nbsp; You will meet them&mdash;cultivating literature on a
little oatmeal&mdash;in London, in Paris, in Rome, in St.
Petersburg, in Tokio, in Honolulu.&nbsp; They are always waiting
for remittances, and they are always on the move.&nbsp; One of
these wanderers I met at Millar&rsquo;s rooms in
Bloomsbury.&nbsp; She was a fine woman&mdash;robust, large-eyed,
sentimental, but with a certain saving sense of humour.&nbsp; Her
sole means were derived from a weekly letter written for a San
Francisco newspaper.&nbsp; Yet she was setting out to do what she
called &ldquo;the grand tower.&rdquo;&nbsp; She was not so lucky
as the others.&nbsp; I met her at the same rooms a year
afterwards.&nbsp; She had just returned from &ldquo;the grand
tower.&rdquo;&nbsp; She looked awfully worn and ill, and she was
accompanied by a gigantic brigand, who had not a word of any
language save his own incommunicable patois.&nbsp; He breathed
hard and scowled and shrugged his shoulders while he rolled his
eyes and smoked innumerable cigarettes.&nbsp; His name, even when
gently broken to us by his fair introducer, was a wholly
impossible thing.&nbsp; But he was a Count&mdash;or so he
said.&nbsp; And the infatuated correspondent of the Californian
paper was &ldquo;my lady,&rdquo; for she had married the
brute.&nbsp; The Count had probably been a Neapolitan
luggage-porter, or something of the kind, and my own private
opinion is that he beat the poor woman and otherwise ill-treated
her.</p>
<p>Charles Warren Stoddard is another name which pleasantly
connects itself with those days of emergence.&nbsp; There are few
parts of the civilized globe over which &ldquo;dear
Charlie&rdquo;&mdash;as his intimates called him&mdash;has not
trotted.&nbsp; He lived the absolutely &ldquo;natural life&rdquo;
in the South Seas.&nbsp; The <a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>result of that enervating experience
may be seen in two very delightful books, &ldquo;South Sea
Idylls,&rdquo; published over thirty years ago, and &ldquo;The
Island of Tranquil Delights,&rdquo; published in this country a
couple of years since.&nbsp; He travelled all over Europe,
joining a monastic brotherhood at Rome.&nbsp; This he quitted
after a few years&rsquo; experience, his memories of tropical
islands, perhaps, engendering a hankering after the
fleshpots.&nbsp; On one of the Pyramids he met Williamson the
actor&mdash;to become in the fulness of time Williamson the
successful Australian manager&mdash;and on the tomb of the
Pharaohs he gave Williamson an introduction to me, which led to a
very delightful acquaintanceship.&nbsp; From a Japanese poet
named Noguki, who recently produced a wonderful book of verse in
London, I heard that he had met Stoddard in Tokio, and that he
was then on his way to take up a Chair of English Literature at a
University in Washington.&nbsp; But he must have wandered away
from that place of safety, for I next heard of him as having
escaped by the skin of his teeth from the awful seismic disaster
in San Francisco.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t want much money in a
monastery, and you probably get enough to live on while teaching
English literature to the youth of the United States.&nbsp; But,
deducting these two brief periods of retirement from wandering,
Stoddard must have moved around, surveying the wonders of the
world, on an income entirely derived from fugitive articles in
the papers of California.</p>
<p>Stoddard brought me to see Mark Twain at the Langham
Hotel.&nbsp; The two men were great friends, and, indeed, I
believe that some of the descriptive touches in the lectures
delivered in London by Twain were &ldquo;written in&rdquo; by
Stoddard.&nbsp; It was a fearfully foggy afternoon on which we
made our call.&nbsp; Twain was walking up and down his
sitting-room, evidently in a low key.&nbsp; The sight of
Stoddard, however, cheered him.&nbsp; He pointed to a table at
the end of the room, on which were ranged, in vast quantities,
the materials necessary for the compounding of cocktails, and
begged us to help ourselves.&nbsp; When we had got our medicine
&ldquo;fixed&rdquo;&mdash;an operation which our host kindly
undertook for me&mdash;Stoddard asked suddenly:</p>
<p><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>&ldquo;Say, Clemens, what have you done with your
shorthand writer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shot him,&rdquo; replied Twain grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say!&rdquo; exclaimed Stoddard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shot him out into the fog.&nbsp; He couldn&rsquo;t
hurt the fog much.&nbsp; Another ten minutes of him would have
killed <i>me</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then came out the explanation of this short and cryptic
dialogue.&nbsp; In genial conversation with his visitors Twain
got off some uncommonly &ldquo;good things,&rdquo; and, as he
rarely recalled the items that went best, he was induced to
engage a stenographer, who, concealed from him and from his
visitors, should take down the coinage of his wit as it came hot
from the mint.&nbsp; The shorthand writer was duly installed in
his cave.&nbsp; Visitors arrived.&nbsp; But Twain&rsquo;s
conversational powers had deserted him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t scintillate worth a cent&rdquo; would have
been his own way of describing the situation.&nbsp; The knowledge
of the fact that a paid reporter was taking him down seemed to
sterilize his brain.&nbsp; The stenographer had got on the
humorist&rsquo;s nerves.&nbsp; Twain before his visitors opened
not his mouth.</p>
<p>I question, however, whether any stenographer could have
conveyed, by the mere words uttered by Twain in conversation, the
peculiar charm and savour of his impromptus, which lay in the
manner rather than in the matter.&nbsp; Ready, apposite, and
spontaneous, he undoubtedly was; but the melancholy drawl which
he affected, the quaint American accent, the impassive features
of the speaker, added enormously to the value of the
utterance.&nbsp; And these, of course, transcend the powers of a
reporter to reproduce.</p>
<p>Against the advice of his agent&mdash;poor old George Dolby,
who had acted in the same capacity for Dickens&mdash;Twain had
stopped his lectures at the Hanover Square Rooms for a
&ldquo;spell&rdquo; in the provinces.&nbsp; On the evening of the
day on which we called he was to resume the course which he had
abandoned.&nbsp; The low key in which we found him was the result
of the fog, in the first place; and, in the second place, he was
worrying himself by recalling the warnings Dolby had given him
about the danger of interrupting the course <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>originally,
his fear of the power of some new attraction, his knowledge of
the fickleness of public taste.&nbsp; And as the afternoon
advanced the fog grew more dense.&nbsp; We remained with the
depressed humorist until Dolby arrived to escort him to the
rooms.&nbsp; An hour before the time for commencing the lecture
all four of us got into a growler, and were swallowed by the
fog.&nbsp; I have never measured the distance between the Langham
Hotel and Hanover Square, but I think I could manage it in ten
minutes.&nbsp; It took our cabby just three-quarters of an hour
to land his fare.&nbsp; He lost his way twice, and finally was
obliged to get off the box, engage the services of an imp
carrying a link, and lead his dejected horse.&nbsp; Dolby had
been right in getting us off early.&nbsp; When we arrived at the
hall, we had just ten minutes in hand.</p>
<p>Twain was in a state of the most profound depression.&nbsp;
Stoddard and I took our places in the front row of the
stalls.&nbsp; The house was full of fog, and only half full of
audience.&nbsp; Dolby afterwards told me that he had experienced
the greatest difficulty in inducing Twain to appear at all.&nbsp;
An appeal to his honour and the risk of ignoring an engagement
with his public at last prevailed.&nbsp; About five minutes after
the advertised time he came out.&nbsp; He advanced slowly to the
very edge of the platform&mdash;the tips of his pumps, indeed,
went over the edge.&nbsp; He craned his neck, peering through the
mist.&nbsp; In his sad, slow way he commenced:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen . . . I don&rsquo;t know . . .
whether you can see me or not. . . .&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m
here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>You observe that there is nothing in the mere words.&nbsp; But
their spontaneity and appositeness told at once.&nbsp; The effect
was electrical.&nbsp; The audience was put into a good humour,
and the lecture went with a roar of laughter and applause from
start to finish.</p>
<p>Dr. Gordon Hake was a friend whom I made through a review of
his &ldquo;Poems and Parables,&rdquo; printed by my Tapleyan
editor.&nbsp; Hake was a most courtly old gentleman, and when
actively engaged in the pursuit of his profession&mdash;he had
been a general medical practitioner&mdash;must have possessed an
enviable degree of what is known among <a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>physicians as &ldquo;a fine bedside
manner.&rdquo;&nbsp; The doctor had a pleasant little place at
Coombe End, just beyond the spot at which Roehampton Lane
impinges on Wimbledon Common.&nbsp; Under his hospitable roof I
met one or two famous men and a goodly number of men who aspired
to be famous.&nbsp; Of the famous men I shall here make mention
of one only.</p>
<p>George Borrow, author of &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Romany Rye,&rdquo; was an old friend of Hake&rsquo;s, and
I was invited down to Coombe End to meet that very extraordinary
old gentleman.&nbsp; Dr. Hake had taken care to warn me that it
would be as well to say nothing of my contributions to periodical
literature, as Borrow had a great dislike to literary
persons.&nbsp; My claim to that description being of the
slightest, I quite gladly assented, and as a result George Borrow
and I became on fairly friendly terms&mdash;or I had rather put
it: the Gipsy King was less bearish to me than to some of the
others with whom he was thrown into contact.&nbsp; I did not at
that time understand his hostile attitude to contemporary
professors of literature.&nbsp; I do now.&nbsp; Borrow had
enjoyed for a brief period the questionable delights of being
lionized in London society.&nbsp; His &ldquo;Bible in
Spain&rdquo; had created a furore.&nbsp; An immense amount of
curiosity was created as to the personality of a man who had gone
through the extraordinary adventures described in that romantic
book.&nbsp; For a couple of seasons Borrow was invited
everywhere, and then as capriciously he was dropped.&nbsp; At the
end of the sixties, when I met him, the hostesses who had fought
with each other for his presence could not have told you whether
the great man was alive or dead.</p>
<p>A big, broad-shouldered, slightly stooping man, with white
hair, shaven face, and bushy eyebrows, was the George Borrow whom
on a fine summer afternoon I met on the lawn at Coombe End.&nbsp;
He was dressed in rusty broadcloth.&nbsp; At the moment he was
about to take a walk across the common.&nbsp; He did me the
honour to ask me to accompany him.&nbsp; The only book of his
that I had read at that time was &ldquo;The Bible in
Spain.&rdquo;&nbsp; It used to be given to me when I was quite a
little boy as suitable Sunday reading.&nbsp; It was <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>very unlike
the general run of Sunday reading to which I had become
accustomed.&nbsp; It was, indeed, a series of lurid adventures,
hairbreadth escapes, desperate encounters, fire, thunder, murder,
and sudden death&mdash;a boy&rsquo;s book of the most pronounced
type.&nbsp; And its title notwithstanding, I felt, even in those
young days, that the incidents related must have been evolved by
the teeming imagination of a novelist.</p>
<p>My first walk with Borrow confirmed me in the certainty of my
childish instinct.&nbsp; Crude uncritical people, without a due
respect for literary genius, would, on the strength of his
conversation during that walk of mine, have characterized him
offhand as a flamboyant liar.&nbsp; The true explanation is that
he was continually evolving or devising incidents which, once
given shape, remained with him as facts to be thenceforth
remembered and related as occurrences duly observed.&nbsp; I feel
sure that Borrow firmly believed that he had personally
experienced all the eburescent transactions described in his
&ldquo;Bible in Spain.&rdquo;&nbsp; On our way across the common
he was accosted by a tramp.&nbsp; Borrow was infuriate.&nbsp; He
invited the sturdy beggar to fight&mdash;he even began to divest
himself of his broadcloth frock-coat; but the beggar made
off.&nbsp; He was in search of benefactions, not of blows.&nbsp;
Had the beggar been a gipsy, Borrow&rsquo;s attitude would have
been quite friendly.&nbsp; He would have, were it needed,
administered to the wants of the swarthy nomad; but an English
beggar was in the eyes of Borrow simply an habitual criminal, and
as such should be soundly trounced whenever encountered.</p>
<p>In a road t&rsquo;other side the common he took me into a
beerhouse, and called for two half-pints of
&ldquo;swipes.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus in such places they call their
thinnest, sourest, and cheapest ale.&nbsp; Borrow drank his as
one enjoying a rare vintage.&nbsp; With difficulty I sipped a
tipple, which I found to be simply villainous.&nbsp; In the far
corner of the taproom sat a man at a table.&nbsp; He had finished
his mug of ale, and was slumbering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See that fellow?&rdquo; asked Borrow in an impressive
stage whisper.</p>
<p><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I replied faintly, for the beer was
positively making me ill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That man is a murderer.&nbsp; Finish your swipes.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it when we get out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And once out, he proceeded to tell me all about it.&nbsp; Here
he was at his best.&nbsp; You could not help listening, admiring,
and&mdash;almost&mdash;believing.&nbsp; It was so wonderfully
done: the whole invented narrative, the squalid details, the
sordid motive, the escape from justice owing to the presence on
the jury of a friend of the prisoner, the verdict of &ldquo;Not
Guilty&rdquo; rendered by an eleven of the vaunted Palladium
starved into acquiescence by one determined boot-eater&mdash;all
this the venerable old gentleman related with the utmost
sincerity and circumstantiality.</p>
<p>On the following morning I took a walk across the common
unaccompanied.&nbsp; I revisited the little swipe-shop.&nbsp; The
man who had served us was behind the bar.&nbsp; He was the
landlord.&nbsp; Did he recollect serving myself and another
gentleman in the taproom on the previous afternoon?&nbsp; Of
course he remembered.&nbsp; There was a third person in the
taproom at the time?&nbsp; Of course there was.&nbsp; Did he know
anything of that third person?&nbsp; Of course he did.&nbsp; Why,
that was old William Mobbs, of Putney, carter to Mr. &mdash;
(mentioning a market-gardener in the vicinity).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything against him?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything agin William Mobbs!&rdquo; exclaimed mine host
indignantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;William is the most virtuosest man
within a ragious of twenty mile!&nbsp; I b&rsquo;leeve he&rsquo;s
the qui&rsquo;test, law-abidin&rsquo;est old bloke in the
&rsquo;ole world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in this way was Borrow&rsquo;s murderer rehabilitated for
me by one who knew him.</p>
<p>This visit of Borrow&rsquo;s to Dr. Hake came to an abrupt
close in a somewhat melodramatic way.&nbsp; Two families of
gipsies set up an encampment on the common.&nbsp; Hosts who
entertained Borrow in the country had to take their chance of an
incident of that kind happening, for the gipsies seemed to scent
their protector out.&nbsp; He spoke their language, he wrote
their songs.&nbsp; By some of them he was known as their
&ldquo;King.&rdquo;&nbsp; The presence of the nomadic tribe was
immediately <a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>made known to Borrow by one of their dirty but
intelligent scouts.&nbsp; The &ldquo;King&rdquo; thereupon made a
call of ceremony upon his distinguished subjects.&nbsp; When he
returned to Coombe End, he informed Dr. Hake that his friends the
gipsies were in a difficulty about their water-supply, and that
he had taken upon himself to give them permission to fill their
buckets at the good doctor&rsquo;s well.&nbsp; The good doctor
consented with concealed misgiving.&nbsp; His fears were
justified.&nbsp; The gipsies came on to his little estate, and
not only took his water, but took away anything portable that
happened to be lying around.</p>
<p>In his most courteous manner Dr. Hake told his illustrious
guest what had happened.&nbsp; Borrow literally raged.&nbsp; The
man who insulted his Romany friends insulted him.&nbsp; His
friends were incapable of any act of ingratitude to a man whose
hospitality he was accepting.&nbsp; But the worthy Hake insisted
that, as a matter of mere fact, certain fowls, linen, and garden
tools, had disappeared from the place at a time which
synchronized with the Romany incursion.&nbsp; It was
enough.&nbsp; The incensed &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; ordered his
portmanteau to be packed and taken to the station.&nbsp; He flung
out of the house, ignoring the kindly <i>au revoir</i> of his
gentle host.&nbsp; After many moons he came to his senses again,
and was reconciled to one of the most amiable, hospitable, and
accomplished men of his time.</p>
<p>On two or three occasions after my introduction I met Borrow
in town.&nbsp; He had apartments near the Museum.&nbsp; He was
invariably civil.&nbsp; But this I attribute to the fact that I
was able to talk pugilistic lore with him, and to introduce him
to Nat Langham&rsquo;s, a centre of &ldquo;the fancy,&rdquo; of
the existence of which it surprised me to find so great an
admirer of the P.R. completely ignorant.&nbsp; When I proposed
this excursion we were in Charlotte Street, Fitzroy Square, and
Borrow had been met by me as he was walking along the side-path
with a copy of the Old Testament in Hebrew held close to his
failing eyes.&nbsp; He thrust the book into his pocket and
accompanied me.&nbsp; I shrewdly suspect that this was the only
occasion on which a Bible found its way into Nat Langham&rsquo;s
famous crib.</p>
<p><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>Some
time after Borrow&rsquo;s death I was regularly engaged in
writing for the newspapers, and it came in my way to make some
inquiries concerning the circumstances under which he passed
away.&nbsp; They were grim enough.&nbsp; In a lonely old
farmhouse, situated by the whispering reeds of a Suffolk broad,
he breathed his last.&nbsp; He was quite alone at the time when
he was <i>in extremis</i>.&nbsp; And when at last the massive
form was found lying there, cold and stark and dead, it was
gathered up and pressed into a deal box. hastily put together by
the village carpenter, and despatched by rail from the nearest
railway-station&mdash;a sad and tragical ending, surely, for an
imperious genius who had been in his day the lion of a London
season, and whose writings have established a cult comparable
only to that which has arisen over Fitzgerald and the libidinous
old Persian philosopher, whom he made to live again in his
wonderful paraphrase.</p>
<p>Of Dante Gabriel Rossetti I had but a passing glimpse.&nbsp;
The poet-painter called on George Hake (a son of Borrow&rsquo;s
friend) when I happened to be stopping with him at Oxford.&nbsp;
But the impression left is vivid enough.&nbsp; Six or seven years
had passed since the bitter domestic bereavement had taken place
which saddened his life and induced the habit that shortened his
days.&nbsp; In appearance he presented neither the delicate,
almost ascetic, figure of the early portraits nor the wan aspect
of the later likenesses.&nbsp; One might have almost called him
robust.&nbsp; He had the general aspect of a prosperous country
squire.&nbsp; We all three chatted on current topics, and in
Rossetti&rsquo;s contributions to the talk he was now incisive
and epigrammatic, and again fanciful and quaint.&nbsp; He was not
for a moment pessimistic or bitter.&nbsp; The Rossetti presented
to the public is, I know, a very different sort of
individual.&nbsp; I can only repeat that I describe the man as I
saw him during the closing years of the sixties.</p>
<p>Mr. Hall Caine presents a Rossetti of a very different
sort.&nbsp; In a work of autobiography that popular writer
devotes the greater portion of his book to a narrative of his
relations with the poet.&nbsp; Mr. Caine became acquainted with
the poet when <a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>his powers were decaying and his work practically
finished; when he was habitually drugged and incapable of normal
emotions; when he was deserted by his friends, and grateful for
the companionship of almost anybody.</p>
<p>The literary venture of Mark Tapley Ainsworth failed to
justify the auriferous future that his cousin, the novelist, had
prophesied for it.&nbsp; The unfortunate owner was losing over it
more money than he could afford.&nbsp; He called on me to
announce the sad circumstance.&nbsp; He was as joyous as
ever.&nbsp; He laughed merrily as he spoke of his bitter
disappointment.&nbsp; I felt it impossible to sympathize with his
mood.&nbsp; In my crass ignorance of the publishing world, the
death of a magazine was a tragic thing.&nbsp; It affected me
almost as the passing away of some eminent man.&nbsp; We lunched
over the event (a sort of &ldquo;wake,&rdquo; it seemed to me) at
the Blue Posts in Cork Street, and the proprietor of the
magazine, the decease of which was about to be announced, was in
the gayest of spirits.&nbsp; After all, the dear old chap may be
excused at exhibiting some feeling of relief.&nbsp; It had been
for him, as he cheerily explained, &ldquo;a matter of always
paying out, and never paying in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He certainly had not embarrassed himself by paying anything to
me.&nbsp; But the regular occupation had been excellent practice,
and the immediate ponderable result was the formation of a circle
of acquaintances among literary men and artists.&nbsp; We drank,
in excellent claret, to the resurrection of the dead
periodical.&nbsp; But we honoured the toast as those who have no
hope.&nbsp; Mark Tapley and I parted on excellent terms.&nbsp; We
walked down the Burlington Arcade, and took leave of each other
when we reached Piccadilly.&nbsp; His last word was a jape at the
expense of himself and his venture.&nbsp; The last sound I heard
of him was a particularly jolly laugh as he ambled off.</p>
<p>This collapse of the Ainsworthian magazine; my
&ldquo;call&rdquo;; the removal from lodgings in Woburn Place to
chambers in the Temple&mdash;these may be conveniently taken as
roughly marking the end of my informal novitiate.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know whether the habit of giving &ldquo;call
suppers&rdquo; still persists.&nbsp; I was persuaded that the
obligation to invite my friends to <a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>one was incumbent on me.&nbsp; The
repast was ordered at my chambers for eight, and all my guests
turned up.&nbsp; On the other side of Fleet Street, and nearly
opposite Middle Temple Lane, was an oyster-house and restaurant
called Prosser&rsquo;s.&nbsp; At that establishment the supper
was ordered.&nbsp; I regret to say that I recollect very little
of the entertainment.&nbsp; My health was proposed, and a bright
career at the Bar foretold for me by a gentleman who is now an
ornament of the judicial bench.&nbsp; An artist present drew a
picture entitled &ldquo;Coke upon Littleton,&rdquo; which evoked
roars of laughter by reason of its audacious Rabelaisian
humour.&nbsp; And an Hibernian journalist, who is now an English
M.P., sang &ldquo;The Wearin&rsquo; o&rsquo; the
Green.&rdquo;&nbsp; I replied&mdash;coherently&mdash;to the toast
of my health.&nbsp; After that things became a trifle
blurred.&nbsp; Prosser had done me too well.</p>
<h2><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="GutSmall">INTO THE MAELSTROM</span></h2>
<p>A call to the Bar and a residence in the Temple necessitate a
somewhat intimate acquaintance with Fleet Street.&nbsp; But, of
course, they do not make of one a Fleet Street man in the
journalistic meaning of that phrase.&nbsp; Some time was to pass
yet ere I could regard myself as free of the street&mdash;so to
say.&nbsp; The haunts of the Templar are not those of the
Pressman.&nbsp; The former, when of an afternoon he quits the
&ldquo;dusty purlieus of the Law,&rdquo; usually hastens
westward.&nbsp; The haunts of the journalist are in Fleet Street
itself.&nbsp; Yet it was to barristers, after all, that I owed my
initiation into the mysteries of the newspaper world.</p>
<p>In those days a considerable number of young
barristers&mdash;and some old ones&mdash;were more or less
dependent on their contributions to the Press for an
income.&nbsp; Tired of idling in chambers and</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Beckoning the tardy briefs,<br />
The briefs that never came.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>they had struck boldly off into the whirling, throbbing life
that surrounded their quiet cloisters.&nbsp; Among those who were
to influence my career at this stage were &ldquo;Willie&rdquo;
Dixon, son of Hepworth Dixon, the author of &ldquo;Spiritual
Wives&rdquo; and other books which had a mighty vogue in their
day and seem now to be forgotten; Patrick Macdonald, a Scotsman
with a knowledge of Law that would have landed him on the Bench
had he lived to justify the opinion of the solicitors who
&ldquo;discovered&rdquo; him too late; and Robert Williams.&nbsp;
To the former gentlemen I owed my introduction to the Savage
Club, where for a <a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>time I became a frequent visitor, though not qualified
for membership under their drastic first rule&mdash;a rule which
has, I understand, become considerably relaxed, in order to give
admission to that Mammon of Unrighteousness with which clubmen,
among others, are commanded to &ldquo;make friends.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Here, for the first time, I met some of the practical
journalists&mdash;the men whose profession it was to feed the
palpitating monsters of Fleet Street with their mighty pabulum of
&ldquo;copy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But my real introducer was Williams.&nbsp; It was to his
influence that I was indebted for my &ldquo;chance.&rdquo;&nbsp;
His unerring advice, his ungrudging assistance, his fine faith in
my aptitude, made the beginning easy for me.&nbsp; Robert
Williams was, perhaps, the most remarkable man of his time in the
Street of Adventure.&nbsp; He was a Welshman, with but little of
the Welsh temperament save the hopefulness characteristic of that
race.&nbsp; He was a graduate of Jesus College, Oxford, becoming
thereafter a Fellow of Merton.&nbsp; His nickname at the
University was &ldquo;Scholar&rdquo; Williams, which sufficiently
indicates the sort of reputation he had acquired.&nbsp; He was
one of the finest Greek scholars of his day.&nbsp; His
&ldquo;Notes on Aristotle&rdquo; are still regarded as
authoritative by examiners.&nbsp; He was, I think, tutor both to
Lord Rosebery and Lord Lansdowne.&nbsp; He was a member of the
Reform Club before he had ever seen Pall Mall.&nbsp; Lord
Rosebery took a great interest in the career of Williams after he
left Oxford and had flung himself into Fleet Street, for he
married and threw up his Fellowship.</p>
<p>Lord Rosebery&rsquo;s influence took an extremely practical
turn.&nbsp; For instance, he bought the <i>Examiner</i> for
Williams.&nbsp; But the &ldquo;Scholar,&rdquo; although a very
accomplished contributor, had not been cut out by Nature for an
editor.&nbsp; This he proved, not only in his conduct of the
<i>Examiner</i>, but in the founding and editorial management of
a venture which followed.&nbsp; He sold the property which Lord
Rosebery had made over to him, and with the proceeds started a
weekly illustrated paper called <i>Sketch</i>&mdash;to be
distinguished from <i>The Sketch</i> belonging to the Ingram
group, a much more recent candidate for popular favour.&nbsp; The
capital <a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>which Williams had acquired by the sale of the
<i>Examiner</i> was only sufficient to keep his new venture
running for a few weeks.&nbsp; He transferred it to an owner of
sporting papers, in whose hands it died the death.</p>
<p>But the finest journalistic work of &ldquo;Scholar&rdquo;
Williams may be seen in his leading articles in the <i>Daily
Telegraph</i>.&nbsp; For some years he was retained on the staff
of that journal, transferring his services eventually to the
<i>Standard</i>.&nbsp; He had a prodigious memory.&nbsp; In that
respect he was the equal of Lord Macaulay.&nbsp; Indeed, at
Oxford he was always regarded as a &ldquo;coming Lord
Macaulay.&rdquo;&nbsp; He knew Dickens by heart, and his apposite
quotations from that author are more frequent than allusions from
Aristotle.&nbsp; He had a very keen sense of humour, and in
exercising his gifts in that way he had no sort of
compunction.&nbsp; Indeed, I fear that to his habit of
&ldquo;giving away the secrets of the Prison House&rdquo; in
humorous recital and to mixed audiences may be attributed the
events which immediately preceded his transference from
Peterborough Court to Shoe Lane.</p>
<p>A striking appearance was that of Robert Williams.&nbsp; I can
recall vividly his form at this moment as he makes his way down
Fleet Street.&nbsp; In figure he was a miniature Dr.
Johnson&mdash;bulky, short in the neck and short in the
sight.&nbsp; He had a broad, clean-shaven face, and, so far as
his features were concerned, possessed the true forensic
aspect.&nbsp; He went always clad in black, and invariably
proceeded down the street with a book or a paper held close to
his eyes.&nbsp; As he forged his way ahead he constantly collided
with citizens hastening in the opposite direction.&nbsp; These
frequent impacts did not seem to retard his progress or
inconvenience in any way the stolid scholar who walked slowly and
serenely on, oblivious of the frequent rebukes and objurgations
which his progress evoked.&nbsp; He had a loud metallic voice,
which in conversation was always raised, so that his observations
were heard by persons at a considerable distance off.&nbsp; His
laugh&mdash;well it did you good to hear Williams laugh at a
joker, his own or another&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Williams, too, was a man who could not only laugh at a <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>joke against
himself, but could even tell a joke against himself.&nbsp; One of
these stories is worth recalling in this place, although it has
to do, not with his journalistic, but with his barristerial
work.&nbsp; I may perhaps premise this, as elucidatory of the
point of the narrative: Montagu Williams was at that time one of
the most popular men at the Criminal Bar.&nbsp; He was the terror
of evil-doers.&nbsp; And if he were engaged for the prosecution,
the unfortunate man in the dock often pleaded guilty, &ldquo;lest
a worse thing happen unto him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It happened that Robert Williams was briefed one day to
prosecute a prisoner for burglary.&nbsp; The trial took place at
the Old Bailey, and Williams was seated just beneath the dock,
and well within hearing of anything that might transpire
there.&nbsp; The prisoner was duly put forward, the indictment
read, and the malefactor asked to plead.&nbsp; Williams then
heard the following whispered colloquy take place between the
accused man and the warder:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s a-prosecutin&rsquo; me?&rdquo; inquired the
caged gaol-bird.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Williams,&rdquo; whispered the warder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Guilty</span>, me lord!&rdquo; said
the prisoner to the court in the accent of penitential
despair.</p>
<p>In due course Williams rose to enlighten the tribunal as to
certain incidents in the previous career of the individual whom
he was endeavouring to consign to &ldquo;chokey.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
thread of his narrative was, however, cut by the following
conversation, hurriedly battledored between the burglar and his
custodian:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thort,&rdquo; said the man, indignantly reproachful,
&ldquo;you said as Mister Williams was a-prosecutin&rsquo;
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied the warder, &ldquo;that <i>is</i>
Mr. Williams&mdash;Mr. Robert Williams.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed the prisoner, as one become the
subject of a sudden illumination.&nbsp; &ldquo;I thought you
meant Mr. <i>Montagu</i> Williams.&nbsp; I ain&rsquo;t
a-goin&rsquo; to plead guilty to that little beggar. . . .&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">Not Guilty</span>, me lord!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is satisfactory to be able to add that on this occasion,
and in spite of his amended plea.&nbsp; Williams succeeded in
consigning his cynical detractor to a long term of
imprisonment.</p>
<p><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>Once I
accompanied Williams to the Court of Queen&rsquo;s Bench.&nbsp;
On that occasion he was less triumphant.&nbsp; It was at the old
Courts in Westminster.&nbsp; Williams had to move for a new trial
before three of Her Majesty&rsquo;s Judges.&nbsp; One of them
happened to be Blackburn.&nbsp; Williams moved on three
points.&nbsp; He had said but a few words on the first of these
heads, when Blackburn, with that brutal disregard for the
susceptibilities of the Junior Bar for which he was notorious,
cut my unfortunate friend short with the request: &ldquo;Get on
with your next point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Somewhat abashed, Williams proceeded to open his second
argument.&nbsp; He had barely stated his point, when his
tormentor again interrupted with&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us hear what you&rsquo;ve got to say about your
third reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Williams was nettled.&nbsp; The influential solicitor who had
instructed him was in court.&nbsp; He felt that he must make a
stand for his client.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trust, my lord, that I am not irrelevant,&rdquo; he
ventured, with a tone of offended dignity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>But you are</i>!&rdquo; was the brusque retort of
Blackburn (J.).</p>
<p>The effect of this rebuff was so considerable that Williams
attacked his third point without spirit, without interruption,
and without success.</p>
<p>I have said that some of the finest journalistic work of
Robert Williams appeared as &ldquo;leaders&rdquo; in the <i>Daily
Telegraph</i>.&nbsp; I might go farther.&nbsp; In my opinion,
some of those leading articles were, for trip, style, reasoning,
and allusiveness, the best things that had ever appeared in that
newspaper.&nbsp; I am speaking now of the best of Williams, for
he was an unequal writer, and his success depended much on the
sympathy evoked by his subject.&nbsp; He threw the essays off
with consummate ease.&nbsp; I remember congratulating him on this
wonderful facility.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing in it, my dear fellow,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve only to follow strictly the rule of our
office, and your leader will come as easy as sand off a
shovel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the rule?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All leaders,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;are divided into
three paragraphs, <a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>and no paragraph must begin with the word
&lsquo;The.&rsquo;&nbsp; Simple, ain&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; Eh,
what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>An answer which seemed rather to argue that, his extraordinary
journalistic capacity notwithstanding, he regarded the Press with
a sentiment not far removed from cynical contempt.</p>
<p>And yet to have taken a first place as a writer on a journal
boasting such a staff as the <i>Telegraph</i> then possessed
should have gratified the ambition of any ordinary man.&nbsp; Mr.
(subsequently Sir) Edwin Arnold was really Editor, though
nominally working under the direction of Mr. Edward Lawson (now
Lord Burnham).&nbsp; A courteous and accomplished gentleman,
Arnold will perhaps be remembered by posterity in respect of his
&ldquo;Light of Asia.&rdquo;&nbsp; That poem was an awakening for
the easy-going, slow-thinking, credulous,
missionary-meeting-supporting British public, who had been taught
from infancy that Buddha was a false god, and the centre of a
foul and degrading faith.&nbsp; To Sir Edwin Arnold is mainly due
the fact that in England to-day there are thousands who have some
appreciation of the life and the doctrines of &ldquo;the teacher
of Nirvana and the Law.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sir Edwin had the courage of
his Oriental convictions.&nbsp; He chose as his second wife a
Japanese lady.</p>
<p>But the writer who had given the <i>Telegraph</i> its peculiar
<i>cachet</i>, and whose work was readily recognized by the
readers of the paper, was George Augustus Sala.&nbsp; Sala, I
maintain, was the best all-round journalist of his time.&nbsp;
Nothing came amiss to him.&nbsp; Although the <i>Saturday</i> and
Matthew might affect to sneer at the erudition of his
&ldquo;leaders,&rdquo; it may be mentioned here that those
superior critics sometimes mistook for Sala&rsquo;s the work of
Williams, whose scholarship was at least equal to that of the
detractors.&nbsp; As a descriptive writer, Sala was quite without
a rival, and the public soon &ldquo;tumbled&rdquo; to his
piping.&nbsp; The early vogue of the &ldquo;<i>Telly</i>&rdquo;
was due to his brilliant and unceasing series of
pen-pictures.&nbsp; One saw the pageants that he wrote
about.&nbsp; Coronations, royal functions, the marriage of
Princes, great cathedral services&mdash;these incidents lived
again in his vivid columns.&nbsp; Sala&rsquo;s versatility was
amazing.&nbsp; He wrote at <a name="page55"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 55</span>least one remarkable novel; he
illustrated some of his own humours; he is the author of a
ballad&mdash;printed for private circulation only&mdash;of which
Swift would have been proud.&nbsp; His &ldquo;Conversion of
Colonel Quagg&rdquo; is one of the most humorous short stories
ever written.&nbsp; He wrote an excellent burlesque for the
Gaiety Theatre.&nbsp; His articles on Hogarth, contributed to the
<i>Cornhill</i>, at the suggestion of Thackeray, exhibit him as
an art critic of insight and of profound technical
knowledge.&nbsp; His lectures on the conflict between North and
South, delivered on his return from his mission as Special
Correspondent during the American War, drew the town.&nbsp; He
was a fine linguist, and, at a time when the art of after-dinner
speaking was still held in some repute, he was easily first among
many rivals.&nbsp; In the preface to one of his books, he says of
the proprietors of the paper with which he was identified:
&ldquo;They accorded me the treatment of a gentleman and the
wages of an Ambassador.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is pleasant to be able to
reflect that, however high the scale of remuneration may have
been, Sala was always worth a bit more than his pay.</p>
<p>There is one phrase of Sala&rsquo;s which, by means of
quotation, has become a household word.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said Dr. Johnson, &lsquo;let us take a
walk down Fleet Street,&rsquo;&rdquo; is piously repeated even by
well-informed literary persons as a saying of the great
dictionary-maker duly recorded in Boswell&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Life.&rdquo;&nbsp; Johnson and Boswell were both innocent
of it.&nbsp; The saw was one of Sala&rsquo;s harmless forgeries,
and was used by him as the motto of <i>Temple Bar</i> when he
edited that magazine.&nbsp; There appeared in <i>Punch</i> one
week a clever skit entitled &ldquo;Egoes of the
Week.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was a travesty of an article which Sala
was then contributing to the <i>Illustrated London News</i> under
the title of &ldquo;Echoes of the Week.&rdquo;&nbsp; The parody
was merciless, and, as some thought, malicious.&nbsp; The
weaknesses of Sala&rsquo;s manner were rendered with laughable
exaggeration.&nbsp; His peculiarities of diction were ruthlessly
imitated and emphasized.&nbsp; Some of his friends hoped to see
him incensed, and looked forward eagerly for reprisals.&nbsp; But
Sala took the attack lying down, emulating the spirit of his own
Colonel Quagg.&nbsp; And the reason for this evidence <a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>of
magnanimity under attack somewhat puzzled his associates until it
was discovered that the <i>Punch</i> parody was written by Sala
himself!</p>
<p>Godfrey Turner was another of the &ldquo;handy-men&rdquo; of
the <i>Telegraph</i>.&nbsp; He had not that <i>&eacute;lan</i> in
style which characterized his colleague Sala, but he was a most
agreeable essayist, and turned out some extremely neat <i>vers de
soci&eacute;t&eacute;</i>.&nbsp; His song, supposed to be written
by Boswell on Dr. Johnson, has genuine humour.&nbsp; Boswell sets
out sober in the first stanza; he becomes merry as he proceeds;
when he gets to the last verse he is drunk, and blurts out his
real opinion of the great lexicographer.&nbsp; That catastrophic
verse ran something like this, I think:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The man that makes a pun,&rsquo;
says he,<br />
&lsquo;Would e&rsquo;en commit a felony.<br />
And hanged he deserves to be&rsquo;&mdash;<br />
Says (<i>hic</i>) that old fool Doctor Johnson.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Turner was a bit of a purist, and sought always for the
fittest word; and he was as particular in his dress as in his
&ldquo;copy.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was a stickler for &ldquo;good
form,&rdquo; and sometimes, when engaged on a mission, would
offer a gentle hint to some eager correspondent whose manner in
public offended his fastidious taste.&nbsp; Sometimes the hint
was taken in good part; sometimes it was resented.&nbsp; On one
occasion it secured for poor Godfrey a retort which covered him
for a moment with ridicule.&nbsp; It happened in this way:</p>
<p>Some sapient person in society had come to the conclusion that
the ordinary coffin was not constructed on the right hygienic
principles.&nbsp; He contended that we should, when our turns
came, be buried in coffins made of wicker-work.&nbsp; He
constructed quite a number of these melancholy receptacles.&nbsp;
They were brought to Stafford House for exhibition, and the
leaders of Society and the representatives of the Press were
invited to inspect.&nbsp; I attended the quaint and rather
gruesome collection.&nbsp; Among the other journalists present
were my friend Godfrey Turner and Humphreys, the sub-Editor of
the <i>Morning Post</i>.&nbsp; Humphreys was an Irishman, a
hopelessly eccentric individual, negligent in his dress and
flamboyant in his manner.&nbsp; He was a fine fellow, <a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>however, had
a head and beard like those attributed to Homer, and was every
inch a gentleman.&nbsp; His foible was a belief in
spiritualism.&nbsp; That he really believed in the actual
presence of the dear departed I am convinced, for I have been in
his company in the Strand and close to the offices of his own
paper when he has interrupted the conversation to speak with the
spirit of his great-grandfather, which had just made its presence
known to him.&nbsp; The coffins at Stafford House seemed to
appeal to his sense of humour.&nbsp; He became quite hilarious
over them, and addressed several of the noble persons present by
name, slapping belted Earls on the back, and repeating his
cemetery jokes for the benefit of Countesses.&nbsp; This
affronted the fastidious taste of Turner, who at last got
Humphreys into a corner, and thus gently admonished him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, my dear fellow, <i>do</i> let us try and behave
like gentlemen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thry away, me boy.&nbsp; It costs <i>me</i> no
effort!&rdquo; exclaimed Humphreys, leaving his discomfited
friend for the society of a Viscount.</p>
<p>Clement Scott was another of the &ldquo;young
lions.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was not very popular with the other
members of the staff.&nbsp; Sala, I know, disliked him, for he
told me so.&nbsp; Scott was the dramatic critic of the
paper.&nbsp; He wrote a sugary, young-ladylike style that
&ldquo;took&rdquo; with a large section of the public.&nbsp; It
was a chocolate-creamy style, and &ldquo;went
down&rdquo;&mdash;like chocolate creams.&nbsp; He understood the
value of a phrase, and when he got hold of an effective one he
ran it to death.&nbsp; For instance, there are poppies in the
cornfields round Cromer.&nbsp; Probably there is a much greater
profusion of poppies in cornfields in Kent or in Bucks, but Scott
gives to Cromer a kind of monopoly in the right sort of
poppy.&nbsp; The country in that part of East Anglia he
&ldquo;wrote up&rdquo; as &ldquo;Poppyland,&rdquo; to the great
advantage of the Great Eastern Railway Company, to which
corporation he became a sort of unofficial Poet Laureate.&nbsp;
When I first knew him, Scott had not yet &ldquo;discovered&rdquo;
Cromer or written the syrupy sentiments of &ldquo;The Garden of
Sleep.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was eloquent at that period over the
beauties of the Isle of Thanet, for <a name="page58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>&ldquo;Clemmy&rdquo; was a personal
friend of Mr. Joseph Moses Levy, the principal proprietor of the
<i>Telegraph</i>, and was frequently his guest somewhere in the
neighbourhood of Ramsgate.&nbsp; Clement Scott always took
himself very seriously.&nbsp; Now, that was a pose rarely adopted
by the journalists of my day.&nbsp; We regarded our calling as a
means of obtaining a livelihood, certainly, and to that extent a
serious occupation, but in the pursuit of it we gave ourselves no
airs.&nbsp; We considered the whole business rather good fun, and
were upheld by a consciousness of the fact that we were all more
or less humbugs.&nbsp; Scott&rsquo;s nonsense, however, suited
the nonsense of the followers of Peterborough Court, and at a
time of general scepticism it was refreshing to encounter a man
who believed in something, even if that something happened to be
himself.</p>
<p>Another of the &ldquo;young lions&rdquo; who roared in the
Peterborough Court menagerie was Drew Gay.&nbsp; Phil Robinson
perched for a while on the staff, and flitted elsewhere.&nbsp;
All those I have named have finished their accounts with this
world.&nbsp; Bennet Burleigh still lives, a prosperous gentleman,
and the doyen of war-correspondents.&nbsp; Burleigh professed
strong Socialistic principles at a time when they were regarded
by respectable people as the most damnable heresies.&nbsp; My
first experience of a Socialist Club was gained through Bennet
Burleigh.&nbsp; He introduced me one night to the Social
Democratic Club.&nbsp; This select association held its meetings
in the cellars of a new building in Chancery Lane.&nbsp; One had
to dive down two flights of stone steps to the subterranean rooms
of the club.&nbsp; The rooms were full of gaunt, long-haired men
of both home and foreign growth, and women in clinging (and not
very cleanly) raiment.&nbsp; Whiskies and sodas were hospitably
dispensed, and most of the women were smoking cigarettes and
trying to look as though they were quite used to it and liked
it.&nbsp; I encountered Dr. Tanner, the Member for
Mid-Cork.&nbsp; He introduced me to a bright, interesting old
lady, whose name I forget.&nbsp; We had an edifying chat, she and
I, and when, a few nights afterwards, I met Tanner in the Lobby
of the House of Commons, I asked him about the lady to whom he
had introduced me.</p>
<p><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; replied Tanner good-humouredly,
&ldquo;that was the celebrated Madeline Smith.&nbsp; She is a
married woman now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean Madeline Smith, the
murderess?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean Madeline Smith, who was <i>tried</i> for murder,
and for whom the jury found a Scotch verdict of &lsquo;Not
proven,&rsquo;&rdquo; he reminded me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And of such is the Social Democratic Club?&rdquo; I
observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Que voulez-vous?&rdquo; said Tanner, shrugging his
shoulders.</p>
<p>But I have wandered somewhat wide of the matter in hand, which
was to afford a little idea of the principal members of the staff
among whom Robert Williams became enrolled.</p>
<p>Fleet Street&mdash;the thoroughfare itself, I mean&mdash;has
undergone considerable change since those days.&nbsp; Nearly all
the Dickens features have been shorn away from it, and the
Dickens-land that impinged upon it has ceased to be
recognizable.&nbsp; From the West we then entered Fleet Street
through Temple Bar.&nbsp; In the north wing of that historic but
obstructive gateway an old barber plied his calling.&nbsp; He
reminded me of Mr. Krook in &ldquo;Bleak House.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
was never what you would call quite sober.&nbsp; His face was
blotched and fiery with his excesses, and his hand that held the
razor trembled so violently that one wondered how he got through
the day without wounding some of his customers.&nbsp; Once the
operation commenced, however, the trembling ceased, and the razor
sped unerring, steady, expert.&nbsp; What became of the old
fellow when Temple Bar was taken down I have never heard.&nbsp;
He would hardly, I imagine, have survived his
disestablishment.</p>
<p>Sir Henry Meux bought the old structure, and had the Bar
erected again as one of the entrances to Theobald Park.&nbsp; I
have no doubt that Lady Meux had a word to say in the matter, for
Lady Meux was a &ldquo;sport&rdquo; all over.&nbsp; I first knew
her as Valerie Reece, of the Gaiety Theatre, where she was noted
as being the most high-spirited of an extremely high-spirited
lot.&nbsp; Her early days at Theobald Park were remarkable for
some sporting events of a novel and exciting kind.&nbsp;
Thus&mdash;or so the story went&mdash;her ladyship <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>ordered a
cargo of monkeys from India, and had the unfortunate Simian
immigrants let loose in the park.&nbsp; As they fled gibbering
from branch to branch, the determined little sportswoman took
pot-shots at them, and had good fun while the supply held
out.</p>
<p>Close by Temple Bar stood the old &ldquo;Cock&rdquo;
Tavern.&nbsp; It was a snug, smelly, inconvenient, homely,
stuffy, and (I should imagine) hopelessly insanitary old crib,
much resorted to by barristers at lunch-time, for the chops and
steaks were excellent.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Cock&rdquo; port was also
reputed above reproach, but I never quite acquired the port
habit, and should not like to obtrude my opinion; but I
&ldquo;hae ma doots.&rdquo;&nbsp; The tavern will live for a
while in Tennyson&rsquo;s lines:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;O plump head-waiter at the Cock,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To which I most resort.<br />
How goes the time?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis five o&rsquo;clock.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Go fetch a pint of port.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And one notes here that Tennyson owns up to the barbarous
custom of drinking port at five o&rsquo;clock in the
afternoon!&nbsp; Well, the &ldquo;Cock&rdquo; has gone by the
board.&nbsp; A curious incident disturbed its declining
days.&nbsp; A carved rooster was the sign of the tavern, and
stood over the narrow entrance in Fleet Street.&nbsp; While the
owner was under notice to quit his building, the sign was stolen
one night, and has never been recovered from that day to
this.&nbsp; Another &ldquo;Cock&rdquo; Tavern has been opened on
the opposite side of Fleet Street, and lower down.&nbsp; This
place also displays as its sign a carved rooster, which is
believed to be the original from over the way.&nbsp; But it is
<i>not</i> the original bird.&nbsp; That ancient fowl has become
the property of the great American people.&nbsp; The wonder to me
is how they missed collaring Temple Bar!</p>
<p>The widening of Fleet Street by throwing back the building
line of the south side has naturally involved the removal of a
good number of landmarks; and even where the widening has not
been carried out, one observes, with certain pangs of regret, the
disappearance of some well-beloved feature.&nbsp; The
banking-house of Hoare (&ldquo;Mr. W.,&rdquo; as the squeamish <a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>lady called
him) still stands, the carved wallet in its forefront bearing
witness to the &ldquo;pride that apes humility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Gosling&rsquo;s, as I knew it, is gone.&nbsp;
Gosling&rsquo;s I have always identified with Tellson&rsquo;s in
&ldquo;A Tale of Two Cities.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It was very
small, very dark, very ugly, very incommodious. . . .&nbsp; After
bursting open a door of idiotic obstinacity with a weak rattle in
its throat, you fell into Tellson&rsquo;s down two steps, and
came to your senses in a miserable little shop, with two little
counters where the oldest of men made your cheque shake as if the
wind rustled it while they examined the signature by the dingiest
of windows, which were always under a shower-bath of mud from
Fleet Street.&rdquo;&nbsp; The description exactly fits
Gosling&rsquo;s before it got itself a new fa&ccedil;ade and
became the mere branch of a bigger bank.&nbsp; And the Dickens
Fellowship should have looked to it, and preserved for the nation
this memorial of the master.</p>
<p>Close by was a shop for the sale of mechanical toys, in the
window of which a steamer laboured heavily in a
sou&rsquo;-westerly gale, the rolling waves kept in a state of
agitation by clockwork, and the whole effect being particularly
real and naturalistic.&nbsp; The proprietor of this scientific
toy-shop was eventually attacked by the virus that runs through
Fleet Street.&nbsp; He became a newspaper proprietor, and a
successful one.&nbsp; His translation happened in this way: Young
Kenealy, son of the eminent but erratic counsel for the Claimant,
founded a paper called <i>Modern Society</i>.&nbsp; His pious
object was to rehabilitate his late father, and this could only
be accomplished by reopening the whole of the dreary Tichborne
case, of which the public was heartily sick.&nbsp; The paper did
not pay, and it was eventually acquired, as a property, by the
owner of the clockwork ocean.&nbsp; He, worthy man, had no axe to
grind.&nbsp; He retained the services of a pliant editor, and
made the organ a vehicle for that sort of gossip which goes down
so well with suburban matrons.&nbsp; The paper went up by leaps
and bounds.&nbsp; The new proprietor gave himself airs, dressed
the part, exhibited himself in the Park, and in a brief period
had managed to shed all traces of the obsequious Fleet Street <a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>tradesman.&nbsp; He crossed the bar years
since&mdash;perhaps in his mechanical steamer&mdash;but his paper
persists to this day.</p>
<p>At the corner of Chancery Lane, and above the shop of
Partridge and Cooper, was a new restaurant called &ldquo;The
London.&rdquo;&nbsp; The proprietor was a sanguine man, but made
the mistake of being a little before his time.&nbsp; The Fleet
Street men of his period preferred to lunch and dine
uncomfortably.&nbsp; The owner of &ldquo;The London&rdquo; did us
too well, and attended too scrupulously to the nicer amenities of
the table.&nbsp; We tried the establishment, and then returned to
our husks.&nbsp; Outside the new restaurant stood a burly
commissionaire, with puffy red cheeks and purple nose.&nbsp; When
the restaurant closed its doors for ever, the commissionaire
remained, eager to perform the errands of all and sundry.&nbsp;
He was rather a picturesque old fellow, and was for a long time
one of the features of that end of the street.&nbsp; He wore a
red shako, which added greatly to the picturesqueness of his
appearance, and I should not be surprised to learn that in
private life he drank heavily.</p>
<p>The favourite luncheon haunts of the journalist in the
consulate of Plancus were the Cheshire Cheese in Wine Office
Court, and the refreshment bar of Spiers and Pond at Ludgate Hill
Railway-Station.&nbsp; At the latter place, between the hours of
one and three, you were pretty certain to meet a number of
confr&egrave;res.&nbsp; Christopher Pond, one of the partners who
ran the bar and restaurant at Ludgate Hill, was to be seen here
on most days of the week.&nbsp; He was a big, broad-shouldered,
hearty man, who made no secret of his desire to conciliate the
members of the London Press.&nbsp; Among those who were daily
worshippers at this shrine were Tom Hood, the Editor of
<i>Fun</i>; Henry Sampson, then one of Hood&rsquo;s staff, but
afterwards to become famous as the founder of the <i>Referee</i>:
&ldquo;Bill&rdquo; Brunton, the artist; Charles Williams, the
war-correspondent; and John Augustus O&rsquo;Shea, of the
<i>Standard</i>.&nbsp; John Corlett used to drop in occasionally,
and John Ryder, who lived down the line, invariably called in on
his way to the theatre.&nbsp; Ryder was a fine raconteur, and he
had the largest and most varied assortment of amusing
reminiscences of any man I have <a name="page63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>ever met.&nbsp; Mr. Henry Labouchere
used to tell a story of &ldquo;Jack&rdquo; Ryder which was
eminently characteristic of the actor.&nbsp; When Labouchere
produced &ldquo;The Last Days of Pompeii&rdquo; at the old
Queen&rsquo;s Theatre in Long Acre, Ryder was his stage-manager,
and, in his desire to make the production as naturalistic as
possible, he asked Labouchere to obtain some real lions.&nbsp;
Labouchere demurred; Ryder pleaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; objected Labouchere at last, &ldquo;suppose
the lions broke loose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; answered John cheerily,
&ldquo;they&rsquo;d have to eat the band first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another habitu&eacute; of the Ludgate Hill resort was Louis
Lewis.&nbsp; This extraordinary little man was a brother of the
late George Lewis.&nbsp; Like his more illustrious relative,
Louis also was a solicitor.&nbsp; One day Brunton had been having
his lunch at the table in the corner, and before leaving the
artist had made a drawing, on the tablecloth, of a somewhat
Rabelaisian character.&nbsp; Louis Lewis entered as Brunton left,
and took the seat which had been vacated by the artist.&nbsp; He
at once saw the drawing, which appealed to such sense of humour
as he possessed, and began to ogle it, laughing with a peculiar
subdued chuckle which was peculiarly his own.&nbsp; At that
moment Christopher Pond happened to come in.&nbsp; He noticed the
mirth of little Louis, and proceeded to ascertain the cause of
it.&nbsp; When he grasped the gross intention of the drawing, and
as he conceived Lewis to be the author of it, he became extremely
indignant, ordered his waiters to turn the innocent and
protesting man off the premises, and informed those trembling
menials that if any of them ever served the offender again it
would mean instant dismissal.&nbsp; The smirched cloth was then
removed, and at the laundry all evidence that could convict the
real culprit was in due course destroyed.&nbsp; But the incensed
solicitor served a writ on Pond the very next day, and the action
was &ldquo;settled out of court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a gentleman connected with the sporting Press in the
seventies called Barney Briant.&nbsp; No one knew exactly what it
was he wrote, or whether he wrote at all, but he had <a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>obtained an
undoubted reputation as a sporting writer of parts.&nbsp; His
most salient physical peculiarity consisted in the fact that his
elbows seemed to have become glued to his sides.&nbsp; If Barney
shook hands with a man&mdash;and he was for ever shaking
hands&mdash;he moved his arm from the elbow only, never from the
shoulder.&nbsp; I observed on this peculiarity to Reginald
Shirley Brooks (assuredly one of the most amiable and most
talented of the men of his time), and his explanation was
illuminating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Shirley, &ldquo;Barney spends
nearly the whole day in the narrow passage in front of the
Cheshire Cheese bar.&nbsp; To do this in comfort, he has to keep
his elbows well screwed in, to let the customers pass to and from
the dining-room.&nbsp; In the course of generations the arms of
his descendants will grow from the waist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The incident is recorded in this place as illustrating better
than any mere verbal description the exiguous nature of the main
passages of the Cheshire Cheese.&nbsp; The bar in the passage has
been disestablished this many a year.&nbsp; It was a sort of
glass case with barely room for two barmaids, a beer-engine, and
some shelves of bottles.&nbsp; Sala called it &ldquo;the
bird-cage,&rdquo; and the name stuck to the structure ever
after.&nbsp; In recent years the Cheshire Cheese has attracted a
considerable clientele on a claim that it was the favourite Fleet
Street resort of Dr. Johnson.&nbsp; Mr. Seymour Lucas, the Royal
Academician, indeed, adopted the theory without any exhaustive
inquiry, and painted a picture in which the Great Bear is
depicted &ldquo;taking his ease&rdquo; in this inn.&nbsp; There
are some things which we may not know about the author of
&ldquo;Rasselas,&rdquo; but among them, most assuredly, cannot be
numbered the houses of entertainment which he frequented.&nbsp;
Boswell followed old man Johnson about to all his
&ldquo;pubs,&rdquo; and the fact that there is no mention in
Boswell&rsquo;s &ldquo;Life&rdquo; of his hero having visited the
&ldquo;Cheese&rdquo; is evidence presumptive that he never
<i>did</i> visit it.&nbsp; In his time the tavern in Wine Office
Court was the nightly resort of the respectable tradesmen of
Fleet Street who still lived above their shops&mdash;the last
sort of company upon which the Doctor would think of
intruding.</p>
<p><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>But if
the Johnson legend must be dismissed as mythical, the chops,
steaks, beefsteak puddings, and stewed cheeses, were substantial
and indisputable.&nbsp; Godfrey Turner wrote in one of the
Christmas annuals, then in great favour, a description of a meal
at the Cheshire Cheese.&nbsp; The thing was wonderfully well
done, and gave considerable umbrage to the proprietor, and to
some of the literary gentlemen whom the writer introduced.&nbsp;
The waiter in the room downstairs was one Tom Brown, who used to
drive up from his place in the suburbs in a smart dogcart.&nbsp;
William, who had no other name, was a short red-haired man with
(appropriately enough) mutton-chop whiskers, very prominent
teeth, a pink-and-white complexion, and a perennial sheep-like
smile.&nbsp; Diners gave him their orders with minute
particularity, assured that he would communicate their wishes to
the cook, which William never did.&nbsp; This is the sort of
thing that would happen:</p>
<p><span class="smcap">First Customer</span>: &ldquo;A mutton
chop very well done, please, waiter.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>: &ldquo;Well done,
sir?&nbsp; Yessir.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Second Customer</span>: &ldquo;Underdone
chop, William.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span>: &ldquo;Chop underdone,
sir?&nbsp; Very good, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">[<i>Exit</i> <span
class="smcap">William</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">William</span> (<i>heard without</i>):
&ldquo;Cook, two muts down together, cook!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Saturday an enormous beefsteak pudding delightfully
fortified with larks, oysters, mushrooms, and other seasoning,
was served.&nbsp; This monster of the pudding tribe was put down
to boil at one o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and was served with
great ceremony at one o&rsquo;clock on the afternoon of the same
day.&nbsp; Moore, the proprietor, cut the savoury mountain
up.&nbsp; Every seat was taken a quarter of an hour before the
dish made its appearance, and late-comers had to turn
disconsolate away.&nbsp; On one fateful morning&mdash;a cold,
foggy day in mid-winter&mdash;the usual congregation of
pudding-worshippers had gathered together, hungry, expectant,
keen-set.&nbsp; At the stroke of one the step of William was
heard on the stair, and a pungent steam was wafted to the waiting
gourmets.&nbsp; Then all at once was heard a slip, a groan, and,
<a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>last of
all, an awful crash.&nbsp; William, with the pudding in his arms,
had slipped on the top of the flight of stairs leading to the
hall, and the place was flooded with broken pudding-bowl and
dismembered pudding, now mixing itself ineffectually with the
sawdust of the floor.&nbsp; Mingled sighs and oaths arose on all
sides.&nbsp; The mischief was, alas! irreparable.</p>
<p>After this, William was pensioned off by Moore, but the
devoted old man could not be induced to quit the scene in which
most of his life had been passed.&nbsp; He was not permitted to
resume his official position as a waiter, but he turned up every
morning at his usual time, and remained on the premises until
closing-time.&nbsp; They were puzzled at first what to do with
him.&nbsp; At last it was resolved to put him into a leather
apron, and let him pretend to be having a very busy time in the
cellar.&nbsp; From that cool and cobwebby grot he made frequent
emergences during meal-times to indulge the one pleasure left
him&mdash;that of a little familiar talk with an old
customer.&nbsp; One day William was missed and his old customers
knew instinctively that he was dead.&nbsp; The old fellow left
considerable personality and some real estate.</p>
<p>I have now tried to sketch, however indifferently, some of the
centres round which the Fleet Street maelstrom roared.&nbsp;
Ceaselessly for more than twenty years I whirled round and round
in its irresistible eddies.&nbsp; One never hoped, one never
wished, for deliverance from the seething circle.&nbsp; Once
caught up in it, the daily round was discovered to possess a
fascination overwhelming, imperious, inexorable.&nbsp; It was a
career the most strenuous, at once, and the most
irresponsible.&nbsp; There was a sense of freedom, yet one was a
slave of the lamp; a feeling of power, yet one was the mere
mouthpiece of an organ.&nbsp; By the outsider one was alternately
hated and courted, and one went one&rsquo;s way.</p>
<p>As free-lance, as a member of a &ldquo;staff,&rdquo; as
special correspondent, as leader-writer, book-reviewer, and
dramatic critic, my experience has been considerable, and I have
generally found my work delightful; but its greatest charm, after
all, has been in the society of the comrades whom I <a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>have met by
the way.&nbsp; Good-fellowship, loyalty to one another, a fine
sense of chivalry, a constant readiness to help the lame dog over
the style, a stern ostracism of the unhappy wight who evinced a
congenital inability to play the game&mdash;these were the
characteristics of the men of my time.&nbsp; Sitting down in the
afternoon of my day to recall that pleasant past, I now, as I
intimated in my opening chapter, drop all pretence of sequent
autobiography, and proceed to present such groups and incidents,
such characters and scenes, such <i>mots</i> and anecdotes, as
may appeal to those who live in another time and pursue their
calling under other conditions.</p>

68</span>CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="GutSmall">SOCIETY JOURNALISM</span></h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sassiaty is Sassiaty: its lors ar
irresistibl.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Yellowplush Papers</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Society</span> journalism had been founded
just before I began to earn a &ldquo;living wage&rdquo; in Fleet
Street, but its development and popularity were items of later
history.&nbsp; The ball was set rolling by Mr. Thomas Gibson
Bowles&mdash;to become known in other times as the intractable
Conservative Member of Parliament, and the beloved
&ldquo;Tommy&rdquo; Bowles of the man in the street.&nbsp; The
familiar sobriquet only got into print after Bowles captured
King&rsquo;s Lynn in the Tory interest, but he was called by that
playful diminutive long before he entered the House of Commons,
although he himself was probably unaware, as he would certainly
resent, the fact.&nbsp; Pottinger Stephens bestowed upon him the
familiar name, and in Fleet Street and the Strand he was always
known to his Press contemporaries as &ldquo;Tommy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That this gentleman should have turned Liberal in his old age,
and that he should have captured his ancient Conservative
stronghold in Lynn for the Rads, will not seem at all
extraordinary to those who are a little behind the scenes.&nbsp;
Those who accomplish a great deal for their party naturally
expect that their party will do a little for them, provided they
possess the necessary qualifications.&nbsp; Tommy certainly had
the qualifications, and it is equally certain that he &ldquo;put
in&rdquo; a lot of good work for the Tories; but he was never a
<i>persona grata</i> with his leaders.&nbsp; The Conservatives
are rather stupid on matters of birth and parentage, and Bowles
did not come up to their standards.&nbsp; Having fought and lost
two elections &ldquo;on his own,&rdquo; the party sent him <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>down to a
forlorn hope at Lynn.&nbsp; To their surprise and disgust he won
the seat.&nbsp; For years he served the Tories loyally in
Parliament, but when there came a division of loaves and fishes,
Bowles was invariably left out of the reckoning.&nbsp; In the
last Parliament in which he sat on the Conservative benches, he
fell foul of his party, and personally attacked his hereditary
leaders.&nbsp; From his place he alluded to the Salisbury
administration as &ldquo;the H&ocirc;tel Cecil,&rdquo; and
described the Front Bench as &ldquo;a gallery of family
portraits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bowles acquired his knowledge of journalism and his respect
for the conventions of Society on the <i>Morning Post</i>.&nbsp;
He had started life, I believe, in Somerset House, which was just
over the way, and he became imbued with the notion&mdash;a very
profitable notion, as it turned out&mdash;that a paper chiefly
devoted to the &ldquo;hupper suckles,&rdquo; written in their
interests, and employing what he used to call &ldquo;the
passwords of Society,&rdquo; should be a financial success.&nbsp;
To what extent (at that period) Bowles was in Society, or how he
obtained a knowledge of its passwords, or what those cryptic
passwords were, I have never been able to find out; but, as one
astute editorial admonition is &ldquo;Know what you don&rsquo;t
know!&rdquo; those same passwords may have been part of a
pleasant myth.</p>
<p>His paper was duly launched at the price of twopence, and
under the admirable title of <i>Vanity Fair</i>.&nbsp; But the
paper, smartly and even wittily written as it was, would have
failed to reach the somewhat inaccessible class for which its
founder proposed to cater had it not been for his discovery of
Pellegrini, and the appearance in <i>Vanity Fair</i> of that
Italian artist&rsquo;s inimitable cartoons.&nbsp; The price was
raised to sixpence, the paper hit those remote circles for which
it had been destined, &ldquo;Tommy&rsquo;s&rdquo; career was
assured, and Society journalism was established in our midst.</p>
<p>A tremendous number of imitators have sprung up from time to
time&mdash;&ldquo;they had their day, and ceased to
be&rdquo;&mdash;but there were only two other publications that
enjoyed permanent success; and those two, with the first Society
organ founded by Mr. Bowles, constituted, and still constitute,
<a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>what is
understood as Society journalism.&nbsp; The second paper in the
trio was <i>The World</i>, founded by Edmund Yates; and the third
was <i>Truth</i>, established by Henry Labouchere.&nbsp; I was
fortunate enough to write for all three; for two of them I have
written voluminously.</p>
<p>Bowles used to aver that he had no staff.&nbsp; He wrote a
great deal of the paper himself, and his &ldquo;Jehu
Junior&rdquo; articles, written to accompany the cartoons, were
models of what essays should be.&nbsp; Light, epigrammatic,
pungent, and excessively neat, they were the one possible
accompaniment to &ldquo;Ape&rsquo;s&rdquo; caricatures.&nbsp; A
sentence from the &ldquo;Jehu Junior&rdquo; article always
appeared beneath the picture.&nbsp; I can recall a couple.&nbsp;
Beneath the first picture of Disraeli was inscribed: &ldquo;He
educated his party, and dished the Whigs to pass Reform, but to
have become what he is from what he was is the greatest reform of
all.&rdquo;&nbsp; When Bishop Magee made his great speech in the
House of Lords in defence of the Irish Church, his likeness
appeared in the <i>Vanity Fair</i> gallery, and it had appended
to it this extract from the article by Bowles: &ldquo;If
eloquence could justify injustice, he would have saved the Irish
Church.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the output of the able little editor was
always up to sample.</p>
<p>Although Bowles professed to conduct his paper without the aid
of a staff, he engaged regular contributors, which is pretty much
the same thing.&nbsp; These gentlemen were never consulted in a
body.&nbsp; &ldquo;Collectivity&rdquo; was never &ldquo;pretty
Fanny&rsquo;s way,&rdquo; as the Tory party, too late,
discovered.&nbsp; But individual members of the body of
contributors were occasionally summoned to meet their editor and
proprietor at his chambers.&nbsp; When I was first ushered into
the august presence, Bowles had rooms in Palace Chambers, at the
corner of St. James&rsquo;s Street, over against the Palace
itself.&nbsp; He had just commenced his yachting career at that
period, and adopted the mariner&rsquo;s pose ashore to the extent
of receiving you in his bare feet&mdash;to give the impression, I
suppose, of rolling seas and a slippery deck.</p>
<p>But if one did not meet one&rsquo;s confreres in the rooms of
the editor, we were bound to encounter in the outer
world&mdash;perhaps at the printer&rsquo;s or elsewhere.&nbsp;
The printer was <a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>Peter Rankin, of Drury Court&mdash;a dour and
adventurous Scot who, having conveyed a newspaper by means of
registration from its rightful owner, continued the management of
the property on his own account.&nbsp; He had not the success
which usually attends these Napoleonic sportsmen in the Street of
Adventure.&nbsp; He came to grief and death, and nobody seemed to
care.&nbsp; At his printing-offices I met for the first time
Willmott Dixon, then a contributor under the Bowles banner.&nbsp;
Dixon was at that time a fresh-coloured, stout, broad-shouldered
man with an indomitably sweet temper which indicated its
permanence in a dimple in the cheek.</p>
<p>Willmott Dixon had brought into Fleet Street with him much of
the ebullient spirit and readiness for practical fun for which he
was noted at Cambridge in his undergraduate days.&nbsp;
Bon-vivant, raconteur, and essentially good fellow, he was in
general demand as a companion.&nbsp; After the days of our
<i>Vanity</i>, I was associated with Dixon on many other papers,
for he had the pen of a ready writer, and was in considerable
demand.&nbsp; Of all the men I have known, he was the quickest
producer of &ldquo;copy,&rdquo; and he seemed capable of coming
up with his tale of work under any and all conditions.&nbsp; His
sporting articles and stories under the <i>nom de plume</i> of
&ldquo;Thormanby&rdquo; are well known, and his accounts of the
old prize-fights are the best ever written.&nbsp; The amount of
&ldquo;copy&rdquo; produced by Dixon would equal that of any
three ordinary journalists, taking a period of years in the
productive stage of each.&nbsp; But why should I speak of
Willmott Dixon in the past tense?&nbsp; He is now a hale young
fellow of seventy, and within the last few years he has published
three successful novels under his own name, one collection of
sporting stories under his <i>nom de plume</i> of
&ldquo;Thormanby,&rdquo; and an autobiography entitled &ldquo;The
Spice of Life.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is the sort of veteran whom Mr.
Philip Gibbs should take down Fleet Street with him one fine day,
with the idea of presenting him to the young gentlemen who weep
and have hysterics when a newspaper happens to put up the
shutters.&nbsp; Very few, I imagine, of the invertebrate Press
gang of the period will be writing saleable novels at
seventy!</p>
<p><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>Henry
Pottinger Stephens, another of <i>Vanity&rsquo;s</i> regular
contributors, I first met at the office of the publisher.&nbsp;
We were both there on the same errand, I believe, stalking an oof
bird.&nbsp; Stephens had just returned from Paris, where he had
been acting as one of the correspondents of the
<i>Times</i>.&nbsp; He also was to be my associate in other
papers, my companion in other adventures.&nbsp; To these I may
recur in another chapter.</p>
<p>At what date it was I forget, but in the early eighties Bowles
sold the paper to Arthur Evans.&nbsp; The price was, I think,
&pound;20,000.&nbsp; With this Bowles started the <i>Lady</i>,
which, if not perhaps quite his own line of country, promised a
bigger income than would ever be obtainable from his original
venture.&nbsp; Under the new regime I continued to
contribute.&nbsp; The proprietor confined his attention to the
City article.&nbsp; The literary part of the paper was under Mr.
Oliver Fry.&nbsp; From the time of the founding of <i>Vanity
Fair</i> until its purchase half a dozen years ago by the
Harmsworths&mdash;a period of, say, forty years&mdash;it had but
two editors.&nbsp; Thus, the traditions of the paper were
regarded, its tone and policy were continuous, and it retained in
consequence its old subscribers and its old advertisers.&nbsp; An
editorial chair held in forty years by two editors in succession
marks a record.&nbsp; There were several editors during the
Harmsworth epoch.&nbsp; But the new atmosphere did not seem to
suit the old growth.&nbsp; It was sold again.&nbsp; The cartoons
have always been the mainstay and chief attraction of <i>Vanity
Fair</i>.&nbsp; When dear old Pellegrini died, Bowles had
discovered an accomplished successor in &ldquo;Spy.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Over this name Mr. Leslie Ward drew almost continuously for the
paper for many years.&nbsp; Indeed, his work has appeared there
up to a comparatively recent date.</p>
<p>When Edmund Yates founded the <i>World</i>, a departure in
Society journalism was made.&nbsp; The new candidate for popular
favour was to depend on its writing alone for its success.&nbsp;
Yates had no misgivings about the propriety of engaging a
staff.&nbsp; Bowles always held himself aloof from, and socially
superior to, the Fleet Street man.&nbsp; Yates had been a Fleet
Street man himself, and was unlikely to make <a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>that
mistake.&nbsp; He liked to meet his contributors socially.&nbsp;
He was at one with them.&nbsp; And they had an immense liking for
their chief.&nbsp; For, although Yates was as savage as a Mohawk
when he &ldquo;went for&rdquo; his enemies, he was devoted to his
friends.&nbsp; Not infrequently, in the journalistic world, you
will come upon soft-hearted sayers of hard-hearted things.&nbsp;
Yates was a man of that sort.&nbsp; Warm in his friendships,
genial in his manner, sympathetic to the tyro, he was out for
scalps the moment he scented a hint of offence&mdash;it mattered
not whether the offence was intended for him or for one of his
friends.</p>
<p>In the inception of his &ldquo;Journal for Men and
Women,&rdquo; Yates had the assistance of Henry Labouchere and
Grenville Murray.&nbsp; And among the principal writers engaged
to support the new venture were Bernard Becker, Henry Pearse,
Dutton Cook, and Christie Murray.&nbsp; A. M. Broadley did not
join till later on, I think; though when he did join he proved
himself extremely useful in picking up those Society items upon
which the <i>World</i> depended very much in the effort to prove
acceptable to the &ldquo;classes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yates liked to have about him as staff officers men of goodly
presence, gentlemanly address.&nbsp; And he had a horror of
anything soiled or slovenly in the attire of his
contributors.&nbsp; This latter characteristic of the
<i>World&rsquo;s</i> editor accounted for the engagement of lady
journalists.&nbsp; It was, indeed, the paragraph of one of his
women contributors that involved him in the criminal libel suit
brought by Lord Lonsdale, resulting in the incarceration of Yates
in Holloway&mdash;a severe punishment in respect of a stupid
little paragraph, and a punishment the effects of which Yates
carried with him to his dying day.&nbsp; There was one of the
contributors who scarcely came up to the standard of physique
which the editor regarded as desirable.&nbsp; This was Mr. (now
Sir) H. W. Lucy.&nbsp; Yates gave that gentleman his first great
chance of showing his paces as an independent descriptive
reporter of proceedings in the House of Commons.&nbsp;
Lucy&rsquo;s weekly contribution was entitled &ldquo;Under the
Clock, by one of the Hands.&rdquo;&nbsp; The title was supplied
by the chief.</p>
<p><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>Lucy
was a smart little fellow of tremendous industry and always
conscious of his own ability to make his way in the world.&nbsp;
His hair, turning grey even in that far-off time, stood up like
the quills of the porcupine.&nbsp; He always gave you the
impression of a man who had suddenly waked up in a fright.&nbsp;
And the expression that seemed his normal one was that of a
gentle surprise.&nbsp; He became, at another stage in his
successful career, associated with a little Irishman&mdash;Mr.
Harry Furniss&mdash;an artist for some time connected with
<i>Punch</i>.&nbsp; It was a very quaint sight to see the two
little chaps pottering through an art gallery in search of
subjects for their merciless ridicule.&nbsp; Furniss, red-headed
and rotund of paunch, looking like a sort of duodecimo edition of
a City Alderman, whispered his jokes to his companion,
accompanying the witticisms with an engaging smile, Lucy
accepting them with his habitual look of gentle wonder.</p>
<p>Yates himself wrote the neatest, most scintillating, and most
readable paragraphs of any man who has ever essayed that
extraordinarily difficult art.&nbsp; But neither the appeal to
Society, nor the descriptive pictures of Parliament, nor the now
sparkling and now vitriolic paragraphs of the editor, brought on
that happy event which is known in the newspaper world as
&ldquo;turning the corner.&rdquo;&nbsp; That is the happy moment
when the paper becomes increased in circulation, and advertising
returns to the point at which it pays.&nbsp; It is always the
unexpected that happens, and the contributions which raised the
<i>World</i> from the commercial Slough of Despond were a
remarkable series of articles on &ldquo;West End Usurers,&rdquo;
attributed to Mr. Henry Labouchere.&nbsp; As a matter of fact,
however, the material was collected by several persons, and I
understood at the time that the proofs were submitted to Sir
George Lewis before they were passed for the press.</p>
<p>Judging from the style in which some of them were written,
concerning men notoriously wealthy, their filtration through Ely
Place was an entirely necessary proceeding.&nbsp; When the victim
was unlikely to resent attack or attempt reprisals, the onset was
at times very warm indeed.&nbsp; Poor <a name="page75"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>Hubert Jay Maurice was one of these
latter.&nbsp; One never knew what the dapper gentleman&rsquo;s
real name was&mdash;probably Moses.&nbsp; He had been known as
Mr. Jay and as Mr. Maurice.&nbsp; And he ended his days as Mr.
Didcot, a music-hall agent, having succeeded in giving his only
daughter in marriage to the cadet of a noble house.&nbsp; The
Didcot article appeared during Christmas week, and ended with the
pregnant sentence: &ldquo;Indeed, this young man&rsquo;s career
has been so shameless that at this festive season of the year we
will not ask our compositors to set it up in print.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The success of the <i>World</i> once secured, the circulation
went up by leaps and bounds, and Mr. Labouchere, quick to
appreciate the effect of his own suggestion, and willing to
secure for himself the profits to be made by exhibiting and
denouncing the evil that is in the world, soon determined to run
a paper of his own.&nbsp; This was <i>Truth</i>, the third in the
triad of publications that made good a claim to the title of
Society journals.&nbsp; Labouchere went to work very carefully
and systematically in founding the journal which will always be
associated with his name&mdash;a journal, it should be at once
admitted, which, while it did much in the way of airing personal
dislikes, did much more in ridding Society of pests and
parasites, of swindlers and charlatans, than any other journal of
our time.</p>
<p>My friend Robert Williams was consulted concerning the
founding of the new paper.&nbsp; And from him I used to hear how
matters were progressing.&nbsp; From him, for example, I learned
that Mr. Horace Voules, of the <i>Echo</i>, had accepted the
position of manager to the new venture.&nbsp; Voules always
reminded me of the description of another Mr. Vholes as described
in &ldquo;Bleak House.&rdquo;&nbsp; You recall the passage,
perhaps?&nbsp; &ldquo;If you want common-sense, responsibility,
respectability, all united&mdash;Vholes is <i>the</i>
man!&rdquo;&nbsp; Williams was fond of telling a story of the
interview between Labouchere and Voules at the time of the
engagement.&nbsp; The story was <i>ben trovato</i>.&nbsp; But my
own subsequent acquaintance with Mr. Voules convinced me that
there was not any element of fact in it.&nbsp; The dialogue as
reported by &ldquo;Bobbos&rdquo; ran thus:</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Labouchere</span>: &ldquo;I understand,
Mr. Voules, that, in dealing <a name="page76"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>with the outside public, you are apt
to be rather haughty in your manner?&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Voules</span>: &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Labouchere</span>: &ldquo;Now, in your
interviews with my little public, I desire that you will tone
yourself down a little toward their level.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Voules</span> (<i>bridling</i>, <i>but
dignified</i>): &ldquo;Mr. Labouchere, &rsquo;aughty I never ham;
but I &rsquo;ope I &rsquo;ave a proper pride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I can testify personally that, when I knew him, Horace Voules
was perfectly sound in the matter of his aspirates.&nbsp; To me,
indeed, he appeared to be over-solicitous about them.</p>
<p>No sooner had &ldquo;Labby,&rdquo; as he began to be called,
got his venture launched, than he opened an attack on the owners
of the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> in the most systematic, sustained,
and unrelenting vein of personal journalism.&nbsp; Mr.
Labouchere&rsquo;s memoirs, which are in hand, may perhaps relate
that old story.&nbsp; It is no business of mine to stir up the
puddle.&nbsp; Man of the world, politician, diplomatist,
cool-headed as Labouchere had always proved himself, he here
undoubtedly permitted himself to be betrayed into a series of
libels on an old friend, which were in no way creditable to
him.&nbsp; His attacks thereafter were legitimate crusades
against the undetected jackals who prey on the public.&nbsp; And
the public is considerably in his debt in respect of them.&nbsp;
While as to his more piquant and personal libels, it must be
reluctantly admitted that their appearance and the circumstances
which resulted from them added considerably to the jocundity of
those Fleet Street days.</p>
<p>There were quite a number of stories current then as
illustrating the delightful insouciance of Labouchere.&nbsp; Here
are four of them:</p>
<p>When he was in the diplomatic service, he was sent on a
mission to St. Petersburg.&nbsp; Before starting he had a dispute
with the Foreign Office about his expenses.&nbsp; F.O. had its
idea of the scale; Labouchere had his.&nbsp; But the Office
refused to reconsider its decision.&nbsp; Labouchere took his
leave, crossed the Channel, and was, to all appearance,
lost.&nbsp; A week after the appointed time he had not <a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>arrived at
St. Petersburg.&nbsp; A representative of F.O. was sent out on
his trail.&nbsp; He was traced to Paris, and from thence to
Vienna, where he was run to earth.&nbsp; In reply to his
discoverer, he coolly said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Foreign Office refused to pay me my expenses, and
<i>I&rsquo;m walking to St. Petersburg</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was at one time Attach&eacute; at our Embassy in
Washington.&nbsp; The Minister was suddenly recalled to London,
and Labouchere was left in charge.&nbsp; On the morning following
the departure of the Ambassador, one of the members of the United
States Government called.&nbsp; &ldquo;Minister in?&rdquo; he
inquired curtly of Labouchere.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not in,&rdquo;
replied Labby, lighting a cigarette.&nbsp; &ldquo;Guess
I&rsquo;ll call again,&rdquo; said the big politician.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ah, do!&rdquo; said Labouchere sweetly.&nbsp; An hour
afterwards the same Great Man again put in an appearance.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Minister in yet?&rdquo; he inquired sharply.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; answered Labouchere from behind the paper
which he was reading.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can you give me any idea when
he <i>will</i> be back?&rdquo; asked the important senator
impatiently.&nbsp; &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the remotest idea:
<i>he sailed for Europe yesterday</i>,&rdquo; was the soft answer
not altogether calculated to turn away wrath.</p>
<p>When he stood for Northampton, Labouchere&rsquo;s colleague
was Charles Bradlaugh, who frankly avowed his atheism to the
shoemakers and other horny-handed artisans who were his
supporters.&nbsp; Now, Labouchere, who was an old campaigner,
knew that the Liberals of the constituency would not stand
<i>two</i> atheists.&nbsp; The moment his address was circulated,
the Nonconformists took fright, and, although religious topics
were altogether absent from the astute candidate&rsquo;s
pronunciamento, eager Dissent sniffed heterodoxy in every line of
it.&nbsp; Labouchere thereupon sat down and wrote an autograph
letter to every Nonconformist divine, on the register and off it,
asking each of them to meet him, and for the purpose of
discussing those topics which all good Liberals hold dear.&nbsp;
He hired the biggest room in his hotel.&nbsp; He had a line of
chairs drawn up in uncompromising rows along the two principal
side-walls.&nbsp; At the end of the room was a table with a
tumbler <a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>and a carafe of water.&nbsp; Lying promiscuously around
were copies of the <i>Daily News</i> and the <i>Christian
World</i>.&nbsp; The invited ministers turned up to a man.&nbsp;
The candidate&rsquo;s agent met them and conducted them, with
every demonstration of respect, to the seats allotted to
them.&nbsp; When Labouchere, waiting in an ante-chamber, was
informed that they were all come, he entered the room.&nbsp; He
bowed right and left, a sad smile on his lips, a black suit
enveloping his person, and a general air of Chadband emanating
from all parts of him.&nbsp; He took his place behind the table,
poured out a tumbler of water, drank it down with all the gusto
of one who thoroughly enjoyed it, and forthwith addressed his sad
audience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My reverend friends,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;I have
invited you to meet me in order that we may interchange views on
those topics which are of first-class importance to Liberals, and
more especially to Liberals attached to the great, influential
Nonconforming bodies.&nbsp; But before proceeding to the
consideration of mere worldly matters, I shall ask the Reverend
Mr. So-and-So to engage in a few words of prayer, beseeching the
Lord&rsquo;s blessing on our deliberations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That did the trick for him at Northampton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That gentleman an atheist!&rdquo; said the Reverend Mr.
So-and-So to a friend as they left the hotel. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
the first political candidate I ever knew to ask the Divine
guidance in his campaign.&nbsp; He shall have my vote and
my&mdash;er&mdash;little influence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those who know anything about the depth of Labouchere&rsquo;s
religious feelings and the extent of his personal affection for
Dissenters will best appreciate the humour of the situation.</p>
<p>When Labouchere was member for Middlesex&mdash;that was long
before the Northampton days&mdash;the Lord Taunton who sat in the
Upper House was his uncle.&nbsp; A member of the House of Commons
who had mistaken the relationship addressed Labouchere one day on
the Lobby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Labouchere,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just
been in the other House, and I heard your father deliver a most
admirable address.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m more than pleased to hear it,&rdquo;
said Labby; &ldquo;for my father has been dead these ten years,
and until the present moment I never knew where he had got
to!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Between Labouchere on <i>Truth</i> and Yates on the
<i>World</i> there commenced a species of &ldquo;snacking&rdquo;
or sparring which promised from time to time a rush into active
and bitter hostilities.&nbsp; The paragraphs of one paper
bristled with allusions to the slips of &ldquo;Edmund,&rdquo; and
the other paper retorted racily on &ldquo;Henry,&rdquo; and we
all looked out eagerly for an outbreak of real hostility; but it
never came.&nbsp; The doughty champions both feared and respected
each other, and they expended any gall which they may have
secreted during their meditations on other victims.&nbsp; The
papers still adhere pretty nearly to the lines laid down by their
founders, though lacking the personal supervision of those
distinguished editors.&nbsp; Yates died
suddenly&mdash;tragically&mdash;on leaving the stalls of a
theatre, and Labouchere, abandoning both the senate and the
editorial seat, retired to Florence, where he recently
died.&nbsp; The memoirs of &ldquo;Labby&rdquo; should be a
stimulating and piquant collection.</p>
<p>The complete success of the three papers about which I have
been writing naturally provoked a considerable amount of the
sincerest form of flattery, and imitators sprang up like
mushrooms, willing to share the rewards apparently reserved for
those who catered for Society.&nbsp; These misguided adventurers
discovered too late that even a Society editor must have his
aptitudes&mdash;his special qualifications.&nbsp; Some of the new
candidates for popular favour died the death.&nbsp; Others of
them&mdash;dumb witnesses to that hope that &ldquo;springs
eternal in the human breast&rdquo;&mdash;never in their lives
arrived at paying-point, yet exist to this day.&nbsp; They pass
from proprietor to proprietor.&nbsp; No one ever hears at what
price they change hands.&nbsp; No one ever sees a copy sold on a
stall.&nbsp; There is no trace of their existence in the
clubs.&nbsp; Now and then one comes upon a back number in the
coffee-room of an hotel.&nbsp; They are the pathetic derelicts of
the Press&mdash;the pariahs of journalism.&nbsp; They persist by
reason of their absolute badness.&nbsp; Their <a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>persistence
recalls the inference set forth in the lines of Henry S.
Leigh&rsquo;s verses about Uncle John:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;If Uncle John goes living on,<br />
How wicked Uncle John must be!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is amusing to note how proprietors, editors, and
contributors, will differ as to the motive power which has given
the first substantial rise in circulation.&nbsp; Voules always
held&mdash;he has told me so a dozen times&mdash;that the success
of <i>Truth</i> was brought about by the fashion articles of
&ldquo;Madge.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Lucy of the <i>World</i> became
possessed by the belief that the popularity of the Yates venture
was partly due to the appearance therein of his articles from the
gallery of the House of Commons.&nbsp; He determined to establish
a paper on the lines laid down by Yates.&nbsp; And his leading
article was to be his own series, entitled &ldquo;Under the
Clock, by One of the Hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lucy selected <i>Mayfair</i> as the name of the venture on
which he was about to embark.&nbsp; There should be no mistake
about his <i>title</i> to rank as a Society journalist.&nbsp; In
that matter he could ruffle it with the best of them.&nbsp; He
was, however, beset with difficulties from the beginning.&nbsp;
In the first place&mdash;to his immense surprise and
disgust&mdash;he found that Yates entirely declined to abandon
his right in the heading of the Parliamentary articles, which
continued to appear, from another &ldquo;Hand,&rdquo; until long
after the death and burial of Lucy&rsquo;s bantling.</p>
<p>Lucy found certain members of the staff of <i>Mayfair</i>
intractable; the intractable aids declared that they found things
impossible.&nbsp; And no one was greatly surprised when the new
purveyor of social wares put the shutters up.&nbsp; Incidentally,
Mr. Lucy&rsquo;s paper was the means of enriching that harvest of
English literature which is garnered by Mudie.&nbsp; It led to
the publication of a couple of novels.&nbsp; In one of these
works Mr. Lucy drew a character which was instantly recognized as
a portrait of Mr. Christie Murray.&nbsp; Murray had been one of
the intractables on the strength of the <i>Mayfair</i>.&nbsp;
Christie was not only impatient of attack, but he was very well
equipped for hitting back, which in due course he proceeded to
do.&nbsp; Anyone interested in the <a name="page81"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 81</span>literary amenities of the jocund days
may find some diversion in referring to Christie Murray&rsquo;s
&ldquo;The Way of the World.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such merry jousts are
inadmissible in these less strenuous times.</p>
<p>A much longer period of existence was granted to the <i>St.
Stephen&rsquo;s Review</i>, founded by Mr. William Alison.&nbsp;
In the editorial scheme, this organ was to play Parliamentary
measures&mdash;so to speak&mdash;in addition to its piping for
Society.&nbsp; Its political cartoons by Tom Merry did good
service on more than one electoral campaign.&nbsp; Alison was a
member of the Junior Carlton Club, so that it is needless to
indicate the policy for which his paper stood.&nbsp; Alison had
chosen for his sub-editor one of the strangest of the strange
persons who crowd the journalistic mart.&nbsp; His name was
William Tasker.&nbsp; He wrote vapid verses and slushy prose by
the ream, over the name of &ldquo;Edgar Lee.&rdquo;&nbsp; But if
his literary output was of a middling sort, his lying was
first-rate.&nbsp; He had become so much the servant of the habit
that he often believed his own stories.&nbsp; Alison never
contradicted him, and so the faculty increased, and the facility
acquired by the little professor became quite marvellous.&nbsp;
He was an extremely ill-dressed man, and grew the mutton-chop
face fungi for which Frank Richardson affects such a
distaste.&nbsp; He always wore a red tie, and it was always a
soiled one.&nbsp; A bland, propitiatory smile played about the
corners of his mouth.&nbsp; He would rush up to one in the Strand
with this sort of news: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just been to Downing
Street, and Disraeli told me&mdash;this is quite private, mind
you&mdash;that he&rsquo;ll go to the country in
June.&rdquo;&nbsp; The reply might be: &ldquo;Hang it all!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve just left the House of Commons.&nbsp; Dizzy is on his
feet, and has been for the last three-quarters of an
hour.&rdquo;&nbsp; But that sort of facer never disturbed
Tasker.&nbsp; He would shake his head and smile a deprecatory
smile, as he answered: &ldquo;Optical illusion, my dear
fellow.&nbsp; I tell you I&rsquo;ve just left him in Downing
Street.&nbsp; I mentioned your name to him, and he said:
&lsquo;Sound man that; give him my regards.&rsquo;&nbsp; And I
said I would, and so I have.&rdquo;&nbsp; I have heard him tell,
with every detail, of his sprinting prowess.&nbsp; He could not
run fifty yards.&nbsp; And he would <a name="page82"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 82</span>descant on his success on the
race-course, who did not know the meaning of a handicap.&nbsp; He
survived for some years the passing of the journal with which he
was associated.&nbsp; These he devoted to palmistry, astrology,
and other wizard sciences, the profession of which, to a
scientist knowing how to advertise&mdash;and where&mdash;may,
even in these advanced days, yield a living of sorts.</p>
<p>But the surpassing claim of the <i>St. Stephen&rsquo;s
Review</i> to the respectful regard of posterity is the fact that
it introduced Phil May to the British public.&nbsp; A Bohemian of
Bohemians was Phil May when he was discovered, and a Bohemian of
Bohemians he continued to the end&mdash;the all too early
end.&nbsp; When he began to contribute to Alison&rsquo;s paper,
he was engaged in designing dresses for Alias the
costumier.&nbsp; Alias had some funny stories about the
difficulty he experienced in keeping Phil at his work.&nbsp; One
day he arrived at the office having come through a heavy shower
of rain.&nbsp; His boots, coat, and hat, were soaked.&nbsp; The
humane little employer fussed about, induced him to remove his
boots and coat, and provided him with slippers and a studio
jacket.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall &rsquo;ave them dried,&rdquo; he
explained as he hurried off.&nbsp; The dear little chap, however,
locked them up, assured that Phil May would not venture abroad
without his boots and coat and hat.&nbsp; The hour was eleven of
the forenoon.&nbsp; The programme of Alias was to hurry off, see
his customers at one or two theatres, and return about one
o&rsquo;clock and take Phil&mdash;who he hoped would then have
made several good designs&mdash;out to lunch.&nbsp; Passing
Romano&rsquo;s, he thought he would turn in and take a liqueur of
brandy.&nbsp; He entered.&nbsp; There were shouts of laughter at
the end of the bar.&nbsp; In the midst of an admiring crowd of
&ldquo;the boys&rdquo; stood Phil May, fully attired in the
costumier&rsquo;s stock.&nbsp; He wore red Hessian boots to
beyond his knees.&nbsp; On his head was the shako of a gendarme,
and his slim figure was enveloped in a brigand cloak built for a
big man.&nbsp; Of course the designs of the dresses had not been
touched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came here to see if they had got my boots,&rdquo;
Phil explained to the exasperated costumier.&nbsp; &ldquo;Will
you take anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>&ldquo;I vill take <span
class="smcap">You</span>!&rdquo; replied the little man, leading
his designer into the Strand, where they were followed to the
shop by a delighted crowd of urchins, who were divided in opinion
as to whether the thin gentleman in costume was &ldquo;Awthur
Roberts&rdquo; or &ldquo;&rsquo;Enery Hirving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Phil had &ldquo;come into his own,&rdquo; when he was the
favourite artist on <i>Punch</i>&mdash;favourite of the public,
that is to say&mdash;he continued in the Bohemian courses which
he had acquired in the lean and struggling years.&nbsp; At one
time he was ordered horse exercise; and when he got the horse, it
was thought, by the authorities at home, that it would be an
excellent idea for Phil if he went into Fleet Street on horseback
when business took him that way.&nbsp; This, it was thought,
would insure his safe and early return to the domestic
hearth.&nbsp; It answered well&mdash;for a bit.&nbsp; But one
afternoon Phil was riding home from Fleet Street to his house in
Kensington, and in passing through Leicester Square, thought that
he would drop in at the &ldquo;Cosy Club,&rdquo; a small club
then recently founded.&nbsp; He gave his horse in charge of an
urchin to hold for him.&nbsp; It was then four in the
afternoon.&nbsp; At two o&rsquo;clock in the morning a police
constable entered the club to inquire whether one of the members
had left a horse in charge of a boy outside.&nbsp; The secretary
remembered that May was the proud possessor of a steed.&nbsp; But
May had left the club at midnight.&nbsp; He had forgotten all
about his horse, and had driven home in a hansom.</p>

84</span>CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="GutSmall">A GAY SCIENCE</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">To</span> anyone born with a taste for the
theatre, a <i>flair</i> for the public demand in stage
entertainment, and a desire for the society of actors and
actresses, the position of dramatic critic on a London newspaper
should be one of the most coveted berths on the ship.&nbsp; The
opportunity of heralding a good play or of &ldquo;slating&rdquo;
a bad one secures a true moment of satisfaction.&nbsp; Moreover,
the occupation, notwithstanding the late hours, hot theatres, and
liability to corporal punishment, involved, is one of the most
healthy undertakings in the gift of the Press.&nbsp; A continuous
pursuit of this gay science insures longevity.&nbsp; The dramatic
critic is the most long-lived man in the profession.&nbsp; Some
of the dramatic critics whom I knew in the early eighties and
late seventies are still &ldquo;hard at it,&rdquo; I am pleased
to hear.&nbsp; I imagine that the dramatic critic never
dies.&nbsp; Like the majority of the plays upon which he passes
judgment, he is translated or adapted.</p>
<p>John Oxenford, of the <i>Times</i>, was the doyen of the
dramatic critics of my day.&nbsp; It was John&rsquo;s proudest
boast that he never wrote a word in the <i>Thunderer</i> that
could do professional damage to an actor, or take the bread out
of the mouth of an actress.&nbsp; An amiable sentiment, truly,
but scarcely indicative of the critical attitude of a writer
conscientiously performing his duty to the public, his
employers&mdash;ay, and to the stage itself.&nbsp; Often after
our Saturday dinner at the Junior Garrick Club, an association
which I joined some time after my regular engagement as taster of
new plays, I have heard the venerable man <a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>make this
boast in a post-prandial speech.&nbsp; As the great majority of
his hearers were actors, managers, and dramatic authors, the
sentiment was invariably received with abundant applause.</p>
<p>Oxenford suffered for years from a chronic cough, which always
announced his arrival at a theatre, and usually punctuated the
performance throughout the night.&nbsp; Whether it was on account
of this distressing affliction, or because he represented the
leading journal, I do not know, but a box was always put at Mr.
Oxenford&rsquo;s disposition on the first night of a new
play.&nbsp; Two determined &ldquo;dead-heads&rdquo; generally
turned up sooner or later in the great man&rsquo;s box.&nbsp;
These were the late Lord Alfred Paget and John Murphy of Somerset
House.&nbsp; The friendship between these three men, so different
in station and in intellectual capacity, was exposed in a
theatrical organ of the period, and in an article called
&ldquo;Dead-heads: Cornelius Nepos O&rsquo;Mulligan.&rdquo;&nbsp;
O&rsquo;Mulligan was evidently intended for Murphy.&nbsp; He was
therein described as Oxenford&rsquo;s toady, and his mission was
indicated as being that of a diplomatic mediator who would
persuade Oxenford to give a line of notice to some good-looking
young woman on the stage in whom his lordship happened to take a
passing interest.&nbsp; It was further suggested that Lord
Alfred&rsquo;s solicitude for the ambitious artist whom he wished
to befriend was not altogether personal.&nbsp; Lord Alfred, it
was said, was simply interesting himself in furtherance of the
wishes of a third party&mdash;a Very Great Personage.&nbsp; That
I do not believe.&nbsp; But what I do believe is that Oxenford
was innocent of sinister designs on the part of his friends, and
that when a kindly word appeared in the <i>Times</i> regarding
the performance of some third-rate actress, enacting a
fourth-rate part, the record testified to the possession of a
kindly disposition and a congenital incapacity for saying
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Murphy and Lord Alfred were both members of the Junior Garrick
Club, and when the article to which I have alluded came out,
Murphy consulted me as to what course he should take.&nbsp;
Murphy had the baldest expanse of head I have ever
seen&mdash;quite a continent it was.&nbsp; And it was <a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>surrounded by
a fringe of red hair.&nbsp; He was clean-shaven, had a most
bewitching squint, and a Cork accent of peculiar enormity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not for meself I keer,&rdquo; said John to
me, with tears in his voice, &ldquo;but Alfrid&rsquo;s
takin&rsquo; it to hear-r-r-t.&nbsp; He niver slep&rsquo; a wink
since th&rsquo; attack on um come out.&nbsp; Now wh-h-at
<i>had</i> we betther do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no doubt that you and Lord Alfred will live it
down,&rdquo; I told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure it&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m afther tellin&rsquo;
Alfrid meself.&nbsp; &lsquo;Take no notice of um at all,&rsquo;
says I.&nbsp; O&rsquo;ny Alfrid wanted your opinion as
well.&nbsp; He thinks sich a lot of your common-sinse,
bedad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord Alfred doesn&rsquo;t suppose, by any chance, that
<i>I</i> wrote the thing?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alfrid would as soon think of suspectin&rsquo; Jan
Axenford himself,&rdquo; said Murphy.&nbsp; But he hesitated
before he said it; his squint became more pronounced, and there
was such a general air of confusion on his beaming and rubicund
countenance that I was convinced that both the wily conspirators
had attributed the essay to me, and that John had simply been
&ldquo;told off&rdquo; by his noble friend to lure me into an
admission.</p>
<p>Burlesque was still a leading card at the Gaiety, and one or
two other &ldquo;burlesque houses,&rdquo; as they were called,
though opera-bouffe was gradually superseding the old home-made
article, with its pitiful puns and sawdust buffooneries.&nbsp;
And the chorus engaged for these entertainments consisted of
handsome girls possessing limbs suitable for exhibition in pink
or yellow or violet tights.&nbsp; Murphy and Paget were constant
visitors at these theatres.&nbsp; And his lordship would
frequently present to some shapely ornament of the chorus a gold
bangle as a token of his regards, and as an earnest of his desire
for her success in the profession she had adopted.&nbsp; Some
attempt on the part of a necessitous chorus girl to pawn one of
his lordship&rsquo;s bangles led to the discovery that the
ornaments were of little value.&nbsp; And it eventually
transpired that they had been purchased by the gross from a Jew
dealer in Houndsditch.&nbsp; <a name="page87"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 87</span>His lordship always posed among
Bohemians as a poor man, and managers, therefore, thought it
nothing that he should accept free admission to the
playhouses.&nbsp; There was some searching of spirit among them
when the aristocratic dead-head&rsquo;s will was proved.&nbsp; He
&ldquo;cut up&rdquo; for quite a lot of money.&nbsp; And when he
died, John Murphy soon followed&mdash;of a broken heart, they
said, and having nothing more to live for.&nbsp; So passed this
<i>par nobile fratum</i>!</p>
<p>William Holland at one time &ldquo;ran&rdquo; the Surrey
Theatre, with pantomime in the winter, and melodrama during the
remainder of the year.&nbsp; I attended the Surrey during his
occupancy, to notice a new piece by poor Henry Pettitt.&nbsp;
Oxenford had a box as usual.&nbsp; And not only was his sneezing
rather more distressing than usual, but he was accompanied by a
lady whose babble was incessant.&nbsp; This acquaintance of the
venerable critic was a person of no very exalted rank in Society,
and Holland became anxious lest the sternutation and conversation
in the box should interfere with the comfort of those in its
immediate vicinity.&nbsp; During the second
<i>entr&rsquo;acte</i> he thought it well to pay his court to the
eminent exponent of the higher criticism.&nbsp; He knocked at the
door of the box, was bidden to enter, went in, and, greeting the
occupants with his characteristic effusion, inquired:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what do you think of the play, Mr.
Oxenford?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The play?&rdquo; said the old gentleman.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh, the play is rot! . . .&nbsp; What do <i>you</i> think
of it, my dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rot?&rdquo; exclaimed the lady friend thus
addressed&mdash;&ldquo;it&rsquo;s muck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Only the word the fair creature employed was much coarser than
&ldquo;muck,&rdquo; and the anxious manager went away
sorrowing.&nbsp; However, an excellent notice of the melodrama
subsequently appeared in the leading journal.&nbsp; It may
interest a new generation of those who illustrate the gay science
to learn that all the theatrical representative of the
<i>Times</i> received for his services was one hundred pounds a
year.&nbsp; At least, so Mr. Oxenford himself more than once
assured me.</p>
<p>When Mowbray Morris succeeded Oxenford as the representative
<a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>of the
<i>Thunderer</i>, a very different spirit informed those columns
of the <i>Times</i> devoted to the stage.&nbsp; Morris came to
the task impressed with the idea that it was the business of a
critic to criticize.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have at you!&rdquo; was
evidently his motto.&nbsp; And he laid about him right merrily,
not particular whom he might inconvenience by his shrewd thrusts;
for, indeed, he was no respecter of persons, and was suspected of
entertaining an invincible contempt for the personnel of the
British stage.&nbsp; When Morris was appointed, Henry Irving was
in the first flush of his triumph as manager of the Lyceum
Theatre.&nbsp; And the shrewd actor-manager had inaugurated the
custom of giving a reception to his friends on the first night of
a new play.</p>
<p>The reception was held on the stage itself after the
conclusion of the performance.&nbsp; Very agreeable, and even
memorable, functions they were.&nbsp; The stage had been quickly
transformed into a palatial hall, made comfortable by a judicious
arrangement of curtains and palms, and&mdash;as at that advanced
period of the night guests were usually in need of
sustenance&mdash;tables were laid out laden with cold viands in
profusion.&nbsp; And there was plenty to drink.&nbsp; Now, the
attitude of Morris towards the stage was that of a person who did
not accept the existence of the actor as a social fact, and he
resented this surely innocent effort on the part of Irving to
gratify his friends.&nbsp; It would all have been very well had
the new critic kept his opinions on this head to himself.&nbsp;
Unfortunately, he gave them to the readers of his journal.&nbsp;
He attributed sinister motives to the founder of the feast, and
boldly averred that it was an attempt to influence the Press with
&ldquo;chicken and champagne.&rdquo;&nbsp; The phrase
&ldquo;chicken and champagne&rdquo; in this connection persisted
for a long time&mdash;for a much longer time than Mowbray Morris
continued in his post.&nbsp; From the beginning of his managerial
career it had been Irving&rsquo;s great aim to consolidate
friendly relations with the London and provincial
newspapers.&nbsp; And the fearless and unconventional satirist of
&ldquo;chicken and champagne&rdquo; gave the popular manager of
the Lyceum furiously to think.</p>
<p>May I here, in justice to the present policy of the
<i>Times</i> <a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span>in the control of its dramatic columns, acknowledge the
fact that the gentleman who at present represents that journal at
the theatres more nearly approaches the ideal of what a dramatic
critic ought to be than any of the men who were my
contemporaries, and that he is head and shoulders above any of
his own contemporaries?&nbsp; It is pleasant to be able to say
this of any department of a Press which exhibits many of the
symptoms of decadence.&nbsp; Mr. Walkley&rsquo;s attitude
regarding stage affairs is nicely calculated.&nbsp; He is
beautifully poised.&nbsp; He never condescends to a contemptuous
pose.&nbsp; On the other hand, he is never inclined to accept the
dramatic art too seriously.&nbsp; He states his opinions with
playfulness and not with brutality.&nbsp; He exhibits a fine
spirit of detachment.&nbsp; He never insults the professors of
the art.&nbsp; On the other hand, he declines to take those
gentlemen as seriously as they take themselves.&nbsp; Under all
that he writes may be discovered the social philosopher.&nbsp;
His essays are scholarly without pedantry, lively without
vulgarity, piquant without mordacity, and they always afford the
most stimulating &ldquo;reading.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My mention above of Henry Pettitt reminds me of another writer
of melodrama whom we, of the jocund years, were sometimes called
upon to review.&nbsp; This was Paul Merrit.&nbsp; Paul was an
enormously fat man with the absolutely hairless face of a
boy.&nbsp; He had a high falsetto voice, and his
blood-and-thunder dramas were crude, lurid,
penny-plain-and-twopence-coloured productions.&nbsp; He had a
great facility in plots and situations, and, in respect of these
gifts and graces, was called in by Sir Augustus Harris to
collaborate in one or two of the autumn melodramas at Drury
Lane.&nbsp; Paul was the last man in all Europe to whom would
apply the term &ldquo;literary.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet he became a
member of one or two literary clubs.&nbsp; On the day on which
the death of Thomas Carlyle was announced, some of us were
sitting in one of these institutions discussing the passing of
the Sage of Chelsea.&nbsp; To us entered Paul Merrit.&nbsp; He
wore the drawn and despairing expression of one who had suffered
a severe personal bereavement.&nbsp; He had in his hand a journal
containing a long obituary notice of Carlyle.&nbsp; Holding <a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>it towards
us, he said in his high falsetto, shaken by a queer tremolo of
emotion:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, gentlemen, <i>another gap in our
ranks</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The notion was too farcical.&nbsp; The claim of Merrit to a
fellowship with Carlyle dispelled the cloud that the intelligence
of the death of the author of the &ldquo;Sartor Resartus&rdquo;
had superinduced.&nbsp; And, to the great surprise and disgust of
poor Paul, we all burst into an incontrollable roar of
laughter.&nbsp; Merrit eventually abandoned writing and took to
farming.&nbsp; In that occupation, I understand, he discovered
his <i>m&eacute;tier</i>.</p>
<p>I mentioned a little while back that the business of dramatic
criticism is conducive of longevity.&nbsp; When I first went
professionally to the theatre stalls in 1870, until I gave up
that healthy practice in 1890, I saw on first night after first
night the same faces.&nbsp; They never appeared to be ill or
tired.&nbsp; They never sent substitutes on important
<i>premiers</i>.&nbsp; They never appeared to grow any older from
year to year.</p>
<p>There was Joseph Knight, for example.&nbsp; He was occupying
the critic&rsquo;s stall long before I ever saw the inside of a
London theatre, and he continued to occupy it&mdash;with credit
to himself, and to the great satisfaction of the
performers&mdash;for years after my connection with the Press had
ceased.&nbsp; He was a fine, burly, broad-shouldered man.&nbsp;
Hailed from Yorkshire, I think, and with his bronzed face, brown
beard, genial smile, and keen eye, presented more the appearance
of a retired officer of the mercantile marine than of a haunter
of the auditorium, and a man who usually got up in the afternoon,
and came home with the milk in the morning.&nbsp; He had a hearty
way with him, and talked in a torrent that seemed to rush over
pebbles.&nbsp; &ldquo;Willie&rdquo; Wilde used to give a
wonderfully realistic imitation of Jo Knight, which the subject
overhearing in the foyer of the Avenue Theatre one night gravely
resented.&nbsp; But the two men &ldquo;made it up,&rdquo; and
Knight, indeed, became so friendly with his imitator that on one
occasion he asked him to write his weekly article in the
<i>Athen&aelig;um</i> for him.&nbsp; Willie readily consented;
and when the article in due course appeared, it turned out to be
<a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>a really
remarkable travesty of dear Jo&rsquo;s somewhat turgid and
oracular style.&nbsp; The essay gave great delight to those who
were in the secret.&nbsp; But Knight never saw the joke&mdash;I
question whether he ever saw any joke&mdash;and expressed to
Wilde his gratitude for the admirable manner in which he had
filled his place.</p>
<p>Once and only once did I see the &ldquo;Knight Owl&rdquo; in a
rage.&nbsp; Joseph was a sort of pluralist in dramatico-critical
benefices, representing at one time three or four daily and
weekly publications.&nbsp; This fact came to the knowledge of the
very young critic of a very young weekly paper, who thought that
he saw his way to a pungent personal paragraph.&nbsp; The
paragraph duly made its appearance, and Knight was severely taken
to task because he was in the habit of writing about the same
performance in several newspapers.&nbsp; The young critic put it
at half a dozen, which was overshooting the mark by at least
two.&nbsp; At the very next first night of a new play, Knight and
his small accuser were in their stalls before the rising of the
curtain.&nbsp; Knight, perceiving his prey from afar off, made
toward him and, assuming a very threatening attitude, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you wrote about me in your infernal paper
is&mdash;A <span class="smcap">Lie</span>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youthful criticaster adjusted his monocle, produced a
notebook and pencil, and, with the well-bred suavity of a man
dying to oblige his accuser, inquired, &ldquo;How many of it is
a&mdash;er&mdash;lie?&rdquo; and prepared to take down the
correction for use in a future issue.&nbsp; But the torrent of
Knight&rsquo;s speech tumbled unintelligible over the pebbles,
and he returned to his own stall snorting defiance.</p>
<p>Moy Thomas was an excellent judge of what a play ought to be,
and understood also the sort of treatment best suited to the
public for whom he wrote.&nbsp; For many years he wrote the
dramatic notices for the <i>Daily News</i>.&nbsp; In those
far-off days it had a literary staff, the character of which was
not second to that of any morning journal.&nbsp; Thomas&rsquo;s
articles were remarkable for their admirable lucidity, sound
judgment, and polished literary style.&nbsp; He also provided the
dramatic notices for the <i>Graphic</i>.</p>
<p><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>&ldquo;Willie&rdquo; Wilde, whom I have just mentioned
in connection with the burly Joseph Knight, was a determined
first-nighter.&nbsp; He was an exceedingly talkative man, and he
talked so very well that one did not care to stop his agreeable
chatter even when it was inconveniently out of place.&nbsp; One
evening I happened to occupy a stall next to that of a then
well-known gentleman of the Jewish persuasion who commenced in
Fleet Street as an advertising canvasser, and subsequently
blossomed into a newspaper proprietor, although the newspaper in
question was, to quote the immortal excuse of the wet-nurse in
&ldquo;Mr. Midshipman Easy,&rdquo; &ldquo;a very little
one.&rdquo;&nbsp; I imagine he has done well, for the last time I
saw him he was lolling back in a victoria, and driving down
Portland Place with the air of a man who owned all the houses on
both sides.&nbsp; On the occasion to which I allude, he had not
as yet arrived at the victoria stage.&nbsp; Indeed, he had been
released from gaol that very morning.&nbsp; He had been remanded
in custody on a charge of a commercial kind; but being now out on
bail, and having none of that supersensitiveness which would
characterize a Gentile similarly situated, he celebrated his
release by taking his wife to the theatre.&nbsp; Wilde was
sitting immediately behind the pair, and next to William Mackay,
to whom, as the play proceeded, he indulged in a series of
humorous commentaries.&nbsp; Our hero, being very intent on the
play&mdash;an opera-bouffe&mdash;became at last annoyed by the
chatter behind him, and, turning round to Mackay, who had not
uttered a word, said in a voice audible all over the place:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish, sir, you&rsquo;d make less noise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mackay, conscious of innocence and deeply resentful, turned to
Wilde, and observed audibly, with a touch of malice which was
seldom absent from his impromptus:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do keep quiet, Willie; you are annoying the occupant of
the <i>adjoining cell</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A London edition of the <i>New York Herald</i> was published
in the Strand at the time when this little incident happened, and
next morning the critic of that journal, under the head of
&ldquo;An Incident,&rdquo; tacked the story on to his dramatic <a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>notice&mdash;names and all.&nbsp; He added the comment:
&ldquo;A word in season, how good it is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wilde and his friend, who were both Irishmen, and had at
various periods written the dramatic notices for <i>Vanity
Fair</i>, represented the new school of criticism.&nbsp; They
took neither themselves nor the dramatic art seriously.&nbsp;
Accepting the dictum of their fellow-countryman, Sheridan, as to
the purpose of the theatre and the limitations of dramatic art,
their articles were irreverent, audacious, a little
contemptuous.&nbsp; <i>Vanity Fair</i> encouraged this attitude
towards players and playhouses.&nbsp; And, indeed, it was the
natural and inevitable result of the seriousness with which the
critics of the period were beginning to take both themselves and
the theatre.&nbsp; The proprietors of the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>
were greatly interested in theatrical affairs.&nbsp; Mr. Edward
Lawson, now Lord Burnham, was the son-in-law of Mr. Ben Webster,
of the Adelphi Theatre; and that paper led the way in devoting a
considerable space to theatrical matters.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Epoch-making&rdquo; became quite the appropriate phrase to
employ regarding any new production which was unusually well
received.&nbsp; Clement Scott, the critic of the <i>Daily
Telegraph</i>, was an instrument ready to the hand of his
employers.&nbsp; His standard of all dramatic work appeared to be
the Robertson comedies as staged by the Bancrofts&mdash;just as
in later years Mr. William Archer found nothing very good after
&ldquo;The Second Mrs. Tanqueray.&rdquo;&nbsp; That forgotten
comedy was Mr. Archer&rsquo;s &ldquo;epoch-making
play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both Mr. Archer and Clement Scott had served an apprenticeship
on the <i>London Figaro</i>, and surely no two members of a staff
were ever before so unequally yoked together.&nbsp; Scott was
impulsive, always in extremes of heat or cold, and never very
particular as to the accuracy of his phrases.&nbsp; Archer was a
&ldquo;dour body,&rdquo; solid in matter, turgid and dogmatic in
manner, and as solemn in statement as a Presbyterian
meenister.&nbsp; The atmosphere of seriousness by which Mr.
Archer has surrounded himself when dealing with playhouses is,
indeed, impenetrable, fuliginous.</p>
<p>Perhaps, all being said and done, the proper attitude of the
man retained for this sort of work is neither that of <a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>satirical
sceptic and scintillating detractor, nor that of fanatical
worshipper and solemn commentator.&nbsp; Ernest Bendall, in my
time, struck, I think, the golden mean.&nbsp; He was never
betrayed into excessive praise or excessive censure.&nbsp; He
found nothing in the theatre to make such a demand on the
emotions as should call for literary heroics.&nbsp; Yet his
judgments were sound, and they carried weight.&nbsp; He was
temperate in expression, had a natural facility for hitting on
the right word, and he always wrote like a gentleman.&nbsp;
Bendall may have had contemporaries who wrote more brilliantly,
but none who wrote with a nicer sense of his duty to the public,
and with less desire to parade his own idiosyncrasies.&nbsp; A
more admirable selection for the office of Censor under the Lord
Chamberlain could not have been made.</p>
<p>Nesbit was another of the serious exponents of the art of
dramatic criticism.&nbsp; He followed Morris on the <i>Times</i>,
but whether he was his immediate successor, or whether some other
contributor intervened, I do not recollect.&nbsp; I have never
kept a diary, and I have never preserved a letter written to
me.&nbsp; And I would embrace this opportunity of advising any
young journalist who may happen to read these recollections to
make a point of writing up his diary, and of filing letters
possessing any literary value.&nbsp; Had I made a practice of
diarizing, my present task would be very considerably lightened;
and if I had kept my letters from contemporaries, I should by now
have had a very fine collection of autographs upon which to draw
for the entertainment of my readers.&nbsp; Nesbit wrote well, but
he wrote too much.&nbsp; The marvel to me about his work always
was, that, accomplishing so tremendous an output, he was able to
keep his supply in bulk up to his sample.&nbsp; But Nesbit was
dull&mdash;and that&rsquo;s a fact.&nbsp; He and Archer
approached the task of reporting a play much in the attitude of a
Judge taking his seat to try a man for murder.</p>
<p>But there was a third class of reviewer.&nbsp; He adopted
neither the solemn mood affected by Ibsenites and Irvingites, nor
the detached and playful attitude of those who perpetuated
Sheridan&rsquo;s sane assignment of the position of the <a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>stage.&nbsp;
James Davis was a fair representative of this third class.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Jimmy&rdquo; delighted in setting the mummers by the
ears.&nbsp; He attacked without scruple and without mercy.&nbsp;
He had all the audacity of the free-lance, with all the love of
mischief which characterizes the schoolboy.&nbsp; And yet
&ldquo;Jimmy&rdquo; was one of the best-natured little fellows in
the world.&nbsp; But he revelled in what the Germans call
mischief-joy.&nbsp; And when you put a pen into his hand, it ran
to libel as surely as the needle turns to the pole.&nbsp; He
owned at various times the <i>Cuckoo</i>, originally started by
Edmund Yates.&nbsp; He founded the <i>Bat</i>&mdash;wherein he
fell foul of the whole theatrical hierarchy&mdash;and near the
end he established a weekly organ called the <i>Ph&oelig;nix</i>,
which lacked somewhat of his old dash and vim.&nbsp; A member of
the Jewish community, he was wanting in one of the racial
characteristics.&nbsp; He cared nothing for money&mdash;as
money.&nbsp; He married money, and he made money, and all the
time he was flinging money about with both hands.&nbsp; It is
strange to remember that, notwithstanding his early and
persistent attacks on the stage and its professors, he eventually
became a popular writer of musical comedy, and during this period
he made thousands of pounds, and was the means of giving
employment to hundreds of the performers whom he affected to
hate.&nbsp; James was a most cheery companion, a finished
gourmet, a lavish and agreeable host, a determined gambler, and a
rattling good little chap.&nbsp; He went through several
fortunes, died worth nothing, and he was the best bridge-player
of his day.</p>
<p>The serene atmosphere in which the critic of plays dwelt was
seldom disturbed by storms.&nbsp; Tempest did occur, however, to
the intense delight of the newspaper-reading world, and to the
great scandal of the more serious supporters of the British
drama.&nbsp; Thus, Henry Irving found it advisable to take
criminal proceedings against a paper for a perfectly harmless and
very humorous skit written by Mr. G. R. Sims.&nbsp; Never,
surely, in the history of the theatre was so much cry made over
such a contemptible quantity of wool.&nbsp; But we were just
beginning to stand on our dignity, you see, and the Lyceum
manager stood for all <a name="page96"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>that was respectable and
traditional.&nbsp; Never, perhaps, had the suburbs been so moved
as on that occasion.&nbsp; And had Mr. Sims been tried by a jury
drawn from the fastnesses of Brixton, Clapham, and the Camden
Road, he would have had but a short shrift.&nbsp; Happily for all
concerned, the matter was amicably settled in court.&nbsp; It
ended like a French duel&mdash;shots were exchanged, but nobody
was hurt.</p>
<p>A more serious forensic encounter took place in the Court of
Common Pleas.&nbsp; I had not at that time commenced business on
the Press as a regular writer about plays; but I was enormously
interested in all that concerned the drama and I attended the
trial concerning which I shall say a word or two.&nbsp; The case
was called &ldquo;Fairlie <i>v.</i> Blenkinsop.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
came on for hearing before Mr. Justice Keating in the Court of
Common Pleas in Westminster Hall.&nbsp; Fairlie was the lessee
and manager of the St. James&rsquo;s Theatre.</p>
<p>Mr. Fairlie&rsquo;s manager&mdash;&ldquo;producer&rdquo; he
would be termed in these fastidious days&mdash;was Richard
Mansell.&nbsp; Mansell was an Irishman whose real name was
Maitland, and he had been the first to introduce opera-bouffe.
with English words, to a London audience.&nbsp; With very little
money, but with unbounded pluck, he took the Lyceum Theatre, and
produced &ldquo;Chilperic&rdquo; and &ldquo;Le Petit
Faust,&rdquo; bringing Herv&eacute; over from Paris to conduct
the orchestra.&nbsp; The thing was a great success, but Dick
Mansell had about as much notion of theatrical finance as had his
great London predecessor, Dick Sheridan.&nbsp; The money flowed
quickly into the treasury, but it flowed out in even greater
volume.&nbsp; The system of accounts was lax, and Mansell, who
should never have looked back after that successful venture, did
nothing <i>but</i> look back for the rest of his life.&nbsp; He
died a short time since after a long and painful illness.&nbsp;
But to the last he was the hopeful, hearty, handsome Irishman
whom I had met for the first time on the day that the disaster at
Sedan was reported in the papers.</p>
<p>The management opened their theatre with an opera-bouffe
entitled &ldquo;Vert Vert,&rdquo; translated from the French by
Henry Herman, who afterwards made a reputation for himself as the
author of &ldquo;The Silver King.&rdquo;&nbsp; The attack <a
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>made on the
opera by <i>Vanity Fair</i> was fierce, scathing,
unsparing.&nbsp; The writer was especially nasty about the ladies
of the chorus, whom he said could neither act, sing, nor dance,
but who, he supposed, were exhibited before the public because
&ldquo;there are some rich young men about town, and several old
ones, who devote their time and energies to the discovery and
encouragement of dramatic talent in good-looking young
women.&rdquo;&nbsp; That was the gravamen of the
charge&mdash;that and an allusion to a dance called the
&ldquo;Riperelle.&rdquo;&nbsp; Serjeant Ballantine was for the
plaintiff, and Mr. John Day (afterwards Mr. Justice Day) was for
the defendant.</p>
<p>The interest of the occasion centred greatly in the
cross-examination of Mr. Thomas Gibson Bowles, subsequently the
representative of King&rsquo;s Lynn, and the beloved
&ldquo;Tommy&rdquo; of the House of Commons.&nbsp; Ballantine, of
course, could see nothing wrong in anything theatrical, and
contrived by maladroit questions to let &ldquo;Tommy&rdquo; get
in some answers which Day dare not have elicited in chief.&nbsp;
In particular he made the mistake of cross-examining him about
the &ldquo;Riperelle.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It is the cancan in its
essential part,&rdquo; explained Bowles.&nbsp; Ballantine,
rushing on his fate, pressed the witness.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell
us,&rdquo; he thundered, &ldquo;in what the indecency of the
dance consists.&rdquo;&nbsp; Stroking his blonde cavalry
moustache, and smiling pleasantly, Bowles replied, with great
distinctiveness and amid a dead silence: &ldquo;The
&lsquo;Riperelle&rsquo; is an illustration by gesture of the act
of &mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; But the conclusion of the sentence is
scarcely of a kind to be repeated here.&nbsp; It won the
case.&nbsp; The jury found for the defendant without leaving the
box.&nbsp; Mr. Fairlie soon after his theatrical experiences
resumed his proper name of Philips, read for the Bar, was called,
and in 1890 I happened to be with him in settling a case of
newspaper libel in which he was engaged for the plaintiff.&nbsp;
Mr. F. C. Philips has furthermore made a reputation for himself
as a writer of excellent fiction.&nbsp; His &ldquo;As in a
Looking-Glass&rdquo; has gone through many editions, and is to
this day, I understand, &ldquo;asked for&rdquo; at
Mudie&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>That sort of criticism, however, is no longer in vogue, <a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>which for
some reasons, I think, is rather a pity.&nbsp; And one of them is
that theatre-goers have ceased to accept dramatic criticisms as
being in any way a guide to the theatre.&nbsp; Bad plays are so
frequently treated with respectful notices, and the public
reading the criticisms have been so frequently deceived, that
this department of a newspaper&rsquo;s literary contents has
become negligible.&nbsp; The most frank and most business-like
method would be to drop all pretence at criticism, and simply
&ldquo;report&rdquo; each new play.&nbsp; It will come to
that.</p>
<p>A well-known barrister who wrote criticisms on plays was Sir
Douglas Straight.&nbsp; He had not then received the honour of
knighthood.&nbsp; He was the inseparable companion of Montagu
Williams, represented the licensed victuallers in the House of
Commons, and wrote his dramatic criticisms in the <i>Sporting
Times</i>.</p>
<p>It would be impossible to give a complete list of the dramatic
critics who exercised their craft during the couple of decades
that comprise my experience of the front of the house.&nbsp; But
as a suitable conclusion to this chapter on a gay art I shall
endeavour to call up the appearance of the approaches and
auditorium of a leading theatre on the production of an important
work.&nbsp; In an attempt to visualize the scene, some figures
will present themselves that, without this aid to memory,
might&mdash;to my lasting regret&mdash;be overlooked.&nbsp; I
shall not attempt to recall any particular play.&nbsp; But I
shall select what I shall suppose to be a typical first night at
the Lyceum Theatre at the beginning of the eighties.&nbsp; One
proceeds along the Strand leisurely and in chastened mood.&nbsp;
The tail of the pittites is struggling out of the covered passage
that leads to the pit entrance.&nbsp; That passage, by the way,
had been nicknamed by a witty policeman the
&ldquo;Cowshed,&rdquo; in honour of certain elderly ladies who
used to pervade that part of the Strand, and who were accustomed
to take shelter in this recess.&nbsp; Turning out of the Strand
into Wellington Street, one sees the long line of cabs and
carriages discharging their occupants between the classic pillars
which stand before the Lyceum portico.&nbsp; There are as yet no
motors&mdash;no taxi-cabs&mdash;in <a name="page99"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 99</span>this procession.&nbsp; Somehow those
panting vehicles would not have harmonized with the sentiments of
a Lyceum audience.&nbsp; We cross the threshold.&nbsp; On the
right is the box-office, and through the aperture you see the
benign and reverend face of Mr. Joseph Hurst, placid,
gold-spectacled, serene.&nbsp; The vestibule is spacious, heavily
carpeted, and from it an immensely wide flight of steps, covered
in soft, thick stair-carpets, leads to the back of the
circle.&nbsp; On each side of this stairway stand little boys in
Eton suits.&nbsp; They are infant vergers in this temple of art;
for Irving has disestablished the female
programme-seller&mdash;she was perhaps a too frivolous
person&mdash;and has installed these youths in clean collars and
short jackets to conduct the patrons to their seats, and to see
each one provided with a bill of the play.&nbsp; The lights are
subdued.&nbsp; The arriving visitors do not indulge in the
laughter and gay, irresponsible chatter of people entering a
house of opera-bouffe.&nbsp; Here is more serious business, be
assured.&nbsp; Our voices, as we advance to the foot of the
stairs, are subdued, like the lights.&nbsp; The moving crowd has
more the aspect of a congregation than of a theatrical
audience.</p>
<p>At the top of the stairs stands a tall man in a reddish
beard.&nbsp; He is in evening-dress, but wears no decoration of
any kind.&nbsp; Yet he is there to receive this distinguished
throng.&nbsp; There is a gracious bow to each as he passes, and
to some an extended hand and a sedate greeting given in a rich
Dublin brogue.&nbsp; For the gentleman in the red beard is Mr
Bram Stoker, the business man, chief bottle-holder and Boswell,
of the Lyceum manager.&nbsp; Bram is one of your genuine
hero-worshippers.&nbsp; He abandoned a big berth under the Dublin
Corporation to follow the fortunes of the Chief.&nbsp; He makes
much of his hero&rsquo;s friends on the Press, and does his best
to conciliate his detractors.&nbsp; He manages Irving&rsquo;s
finances&mdash;as far as the manager will permit their
supervision.&nbsp; And he writes the Chief&rsquo;s after-dinner
speeches and his lectures on Shakespeare and the musical
glasses.&nbsp; As he smiles on us now, he little foresees what
the future holds for Irving and himself.&nbsp; No gloomy
anticipations intrude as we pass the well-pleased priest of the
vestibule.&nbsp; <a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>The Irving regime is for all time, and the &ldquo;wing
of friendship shall never moult a feather.&rdquo;&nbsp; Alas for
the futility of human foresight!&nbsp; Poor Bram has himself now
gone to solve the great mystery.</p>
<p>At last we have reached our stalls&mdash;you and I&mdash;and
have time to look about us.&nbsp; The attendant acolyte has
provided us with programmes.&nbsp; There is a subdued air of
expectancy abroad.&nbsp; Conversation is carried on in decorous
accents.&nbsp; There is no laughter.&nbsp; Even the deep bass of
Jo Knight is tempered to the occasion.&nbsp; The orchestra files
in.&nbsp; Mr. Hamilton Clarke takes his place above the tuneful
choir.&nbsp; The popular parts of the house are crammed.&nbsp;
The seasoned playgoers who have fought their way through the
&ldquo;Cowshed&rdquo; to the front row of the pit point out to
each other the eminent persons as they proceed to their
stalls.&nbsp; They are not always infallible in their
identification&mdash;these quidnuncs of the pit.&nbsp; Mr. Moy
Thomas is confidently pointed out as Sir Garnet Wolseley.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Looks diff&rsquo;rent in his uniform, don&rsquo;t
he?&rdquo; observes the lady recipient of the information.&nbsp;
I have heard them point out Lennox Browne as the Duke of Argyll,
Sir Francis Jeune as Lord Leighton, and Mr. Hume Williams as Mr.
Walter of Printing-House Square&mdash;a gentleman rarely seen at
these functions, and one whose name, one would imagine, would
hardly be known to the public of the pit.&nbsp; These
illuminating asides were always delivered with the utmost
confidence.&nbsp; And upon one such occasion I was overjoyed to
hear myself identified and accepted as Cardinal Manning&mdash;an
ecclesiastic to whom the theatre was anathema, whose priests were
forbidden the playhouse, although, strangely enough, they were
left free to patronize the music-halls.</p>
<p>On these first nights at the Lyceum the occupants of the
stalls and boxes the gathering is representative of various
strata of Society.&nbsp; High finance and high philanthropy are
there in the person of the Baroness Burdett-Coutts, who was long
and generally supposed to have financed the Lyceum.&nbsp; This
has now been officially contradicted by the authorized
biography.&nbsp; All I can say is, that the Baroness might have
done worse with her money.&nbsp; <a name="page101"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>Sir George Lewis, eyeglass duly
adjusted, stands surveying the house and nodding to his many
acquaintances.&nbsp; On hearing of the death of Sir George an old
friend of his spoke of him as having gone to learn &ldquo;the
great Secret.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;They will find,&rdquo; said a
lady, &ldquo;that it is no secret from Sir George.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The higher branch of the profession is represented by Sir Edward
Clarke, always looking fierce, and always feeling much the
reverse, his short, square figure and &ldquo;Dundreary&rdquo;
whiskers savouring much of the &ldquo;City&rdquo; which he loves,
and in which he began life.&nbsp; Frank Lockwood, towering,
genial, and majestic, does not permit his natural humour to
become abated even in this grave gathering.&nbsp; Mr.
Watts-Dunton, brisk and beady-eyed, busies himself with his
playbill, and makes no pretence of hearing the remarks which Mr.
Percy Fitzgerald passes on to him.&nbsp; Clement Scott,
self-conscious and upheld by a sense of the importance of the
occasion&mdash;and of his own&mdash;divests himself of his fur
coat, and settles himself in his stall, assuming an expression of
the deepest melancholy.&nbsp; Edmund Yates&mdash;evidently bored
by, and sceptical concerning, the pervading air of
gravity&mdash;discusses mere <i>World</i>-ly matters with his
accomplished critic, Dutton Cook.&nbsp; Oscar Wilde, seated
beside his pretty wife, preserves the cynical smile which
characterizes him.&nbsp; Joseph Hatton&mdash;one of
Irving&rsquo;s most devoted literary henchmen&mdash;beams, like
another Mr. Fezziwig, &ldquo;one vast, substantial
smile.&rdquo;&nbsp; Knight is accompanied by a lady of great
personal attractions&mdash;of a classic beauty, one might have
said.&nbsp; It is the accomplished pluralist&rsquo;s
daughter.&nbsp; Frank Marshall, of the leonine head, looks as
though he were anticipating one of the great moments of his
life.&nbsp; And so he is.&nbsp; His admiration of Irving is
sincere and whole-hearted.&nbsp; In his view Irving can do no
wrong.&nbsp; Charles Dunphy, of the <i>Morning Post</i>, seated
next to Howe, of the abhorred <i>Morning Advertiser</i>, takes a
mental note of the Society persons who are present, and inquires
after the health, I hope, of Howe&rsquo;s father.&nbsp; For Howe
is the son of the veteran actor of that name, now a member of the
Irving company, and the son is present to sit in judgment of his
parent.&nbsp; It is&mdash;to quote a phrase of
Labouchere&rsquo;s, in his speech to <a name="page102"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 102</span>the jury in a famous libel
case&mdash;a reversal of the old Scriptural legend:
&ldquo;Instead of Abraham offering up Isaac, we are presented
with the spectacle of Isaac offering up Abraham.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On these first nights at the Lyceum there are a great many
persons present whom one never sees on other occasions or at
other theatres.&nbsp; If Bram Stoker had his way, they would not
be sitting here and now.&nbsp; Mr. Stoker&rsquo;s eye is ever on
the main chance, and he resents the sort of dead-head out of whom
you cannot get even a newspaper paragraph.&nbsp; But Irving has
his way in all these matters, and the presence of this
unproductive contingent testifies to a trait only too rare both
in men and managers.&nbsp; Princely in his hospitalities,
generous to a fault, Irving was above all capable of a lasting
gratitude.&nbsp; These dead-heads were the recurring evidence of
this sentiment.&nbsp; They were those who had been kind to him in
early days, those who had faith in him when, as yet, the public
had not accepted him.&nbsp; These he never forgot.&nbsp; And it
is one of the little circumstances in his career as manager which
I like most to remember.&nbsp; For, truth to tell, there are some
of them that I would quite willingly forget.</p>
<p>Byron Webber, burly and black-bearded, appears rather restive
under the restraint of the Lyceum auditorium.&nbsp; Tom
Catling&rsquo;s genial smile indicates that no amount of exterior
depression can affect a spirit tuned to gentle enjoyment wherever
two or three of his fellow-creatures are gathered together.&nbsp;
Among the others who are constitutionally incapable of assuming
the grave expression suitable to the occasion are Bendall the
bland; Chance Newton, the Aristarchus <i>cum</i> Autolycus of the
stalls; Burnand, beaming beatific&mdash;of <i>Punch</i>. . .
.&nbsp; But the orchestra has ceased, and the curtain is going
up.</p>
<p>One could not but admire Irving.&nbsp; He compelled
admiration.&nbsp; But I never could enroll myself among the
congregation of his worshippers.&nbsp; He had a magnetic and
dominating personality; he was that strange portent&mdash;a
gentleman of Nature&rsquo;s own making; he was princely in his
dealings; he was an accomplished stage-manager; his ideals were
of <a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>the
highest.&nbsp; But, in my opinion, he was never a great
actor.&nbsp; He most nearly approached histrionic genius when
cast for a part in which his outstanding mannerisms became
utilized as qualities.&nbsp; In parts where they could not be
made characteristic of the part, they were excrescences.&nbsp;
Thus, I have always held that the actor&rsquo;s best parts were
Digby Grand in &ldquo;Two Roses,&rdquo; and Mathias in &ldquo;The
Bells&rdquo;; and his most deplorable efforts, Othello and
Macbeth.</p>
<p>But whatever his shortcomings, he deserved better of his day
and generation than to have been made the subject of Mr.
Brereton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Life.&rdquo;</p>

104</span>CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE PASSING OF THE PURITAN
SABBATH</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the course of the decades of
which I am writing, London became the centre of a silent,
gradual, irresistible, and altogether welcome revolution.&nbsp;
It witnessed the passing away of the Puritan Sabbath and the
evolution of the Rational Sunday.&nbsp; So quietly did the change
evolve itself that no man could mark the hour or the year of its
completion.&nbsp; But the historian of the passing moment, the
working journalist of the period affected, had at all events a
unique opportunity of noting the events which led to our gradual
emergence from the national gloom generated in these islands more
than three centuries ago.</p>
<p>London in the sixties and early seventies was the saddest and
most gloomy capital in Europe.&nbsp; In the morning church bells
clanged over empty streets.&nbsp; An expression of misery might
be read on the faces of the few hurrying pedestrians.&nbsp; A
curious silence pervaded the thoroughfares.&nbsp; At the hours
for repairing to church or chapel, sad-faced men and women, and
demure little hypocrites of boys and girls in stiff Sunday best,
made dutiful marches.&nbsp; After church came the awful midday
meal of roast beef, Yorkshire pudding, and apple tart.&nbsp; The
afternoon was usually devoted to sleep.</p>
<p>The proletariat as a rule remained in bed until the
public-houses opened.&nbsp; Crowds of soddened creatures,
suffering yet from the effects of Saturday night&rsquo;s
carousals, clustered round the doors of the gin-palaces, eager to
obtain &ldquo;a hair of the dog that bit them.&rdquo;&nbsp; When
at last the portals did open, a clamorous congregation besieged
the bars, and one beheld, perhaps, the origin of the phrase which
tells of those <a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>who do &ldquo;a roaring trade.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the
Seven Dials, in Clare Market, across the water in Southwark and
Blackfriars, the &ldquo;pub&rdquo; proclaimed itself as the most
popular institution in all England.&nbsp; It is quite impossible
for the younger generation to picture the scenes that were
witnessed on Sunday nights just before and just after closing
hour at these houses of refreshment.&nbsp; At that time Great
Britain might easily have boasted of being the most drunken
nation in the world.&nbsp; As the doors of the taverns swung open
to admit or to vomit forth a votary, one caught a glimpse of
pictures Hogarthian in their stark and shameless
debauchery.&nbsp; I can recall even now the gust of hot,
pestilent air that issued out, and caught the throat and nose of
the passing citizen; the clamorous boom of a hundred excited
conversations pierced and punctuated by the shrill declamation
and hysterical shriek of women&mdash;sometimes suckling their
young in the mephitic miasma of a moral hell.</p>
<p>And who can blame them?&nbsp; They had no other
resource.&nbsp; Here, at least, they might woo a temporary
forgetfulness.&nbsp; By hereditary custom amusement was taboo for
ever for them and for their children.&nbsp; So they slept on a
Sabbath during the close time for publicans, and then they
proceeded in droves to their favourite houses of call, there to
make beasts of themselves.&nbsp; The streets of London on Sunday
night, when the time arrived for the eviction of the
publican&rsquo;s customers into the night, presented a sad
spectacle.&nbsp; In some parts of the Metropolis the scenes
enacted were a disgrace to even what small civilization existed
in those regions.&nbsp; Brawls, assaults, free fights, licence,
&ldquo;language,&rdquo; brought to a lurid close the hours of the
holy day.</p>
<p>Thus the proletariat.&nbsp; And the more favoured
classes&mdash;how of them?&nbsp; Well, they were&mdash;or such of
them as were acquainted with Fellows of the Zoological
Society&mdash;at liberty to visit the Zoo!&nbsp; By a great many
worthy persons even this educational diversion was regarded with
extreme disfavour.&nbsp; And I have known a father of a family, a
gentleman of position, a person of business aptitudes, and in the
ordinary affairs of life accredited with more than his share of
common-sense, refuse to permit his daughters to <a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>make use of
Fellows&rsquo; tickets admitting to the Gardens on Sunday.&nbsp;
Quite gravely&mdash;and quite honestly, I believe&mdash;he
explained his action on the ground that a visit to the Zoo on
Sunday was a breach of the Commandment which adjures us to
&ldquo;keep holy the Sabbath day.&rdquo;&nbsp; How many fathers
would adopt that course to-day?&nbsp; And supposing the paternal
prohibition were uttered, how many daughters do you suppose would
regard it?&nbsp; The fact that rest may also mean recreation has
become an article of the Londoner&rsquo;s creed.&nbsp; The parks
are now provided with excellent bands.&nbsp; The environs of the
city are supplied with golf-links.&nbsp; The lawn-tennis courts
of the suburbs are used on Sundays by those to whom the Sabbath
is, perhaps, the only day in the week on which they can be sure
of a game.&nbsp; In the evening there are concerts.&nbsp; The
innocent gaiety of Society is catered for at a hundred West End
restaurants and hotels.&nbsp; While the bike and the motor have
taken roving Londoners farther afield for their well-earned
seventh-day cessation from work.&nbsp; The Puritan Sabbath has
died the death.&nbsp; The Rational Sunday has come to stay.</p>
<p>And what were the causes&mdash;immediate and
remote&mdash;which have led up to this very important and
desirable result?&nbsp; It was not effected by any systematic
preaching of a propaganda.&nbsp; Moral and social reforms are not
secured in that way.&nbsp; Politicians, keen to observe the
tendency of public taste, sometimes attempt to run with it, and
then accept the honour of having created it.&nbsp; Perhaps in the
whole history of legislation no more delightful instance of this
has been afforded than in some of the enactments of the
Administration.&nbsp; They brought in a measure of spoliation
called a Licensing Bill, and they included in their Finance Bill
a crushing tax on spirits.&nbsp; The avowed object of both
measures was declared by their authors to be to stamp out the
curse of drink.&nbsp; Chadband himself never rose to such heights
of hypocrisy, or uttered, with Puritan unction, such atrocious
cant.&nbsp; The moment selected by Mr. Asquith and his friends
for making Great Britain sober was the moment when it had become
patent to the world that Great Britain had grown sober on its own
account!</p>
<p><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>The
efforts of the Sunday League must not be omitted in any attempt
to assign their places to the influences at work in the
emancipation of the English from the slavery of the Puritan
Sabbath.&nbsp; The League came forward at what is called
&ldquo;the psychological moment&rdquo; to supply a demand which
the growing intelligence of the people had created.&nbsp; The
first great impetus given to the rational observance of a seventh
day was given by the general adoption of the bike by the youth of
both sexes.&nbsp; This easy, safe, quick, and inexpensive mode of
transit gave almost immediate pretext for revolt against the
ancient domestic enactments.&nbsp; The call of the long white
roads sounded in the ears of the boys and girls.&nbsp; Wider
vistas opened up before them.&nbsp; Inaccessible places were
brought near.&nbsp; Even the attractions of the Sunday dinner of
roast beef no longer allured those who wished to be early
afield.&nbsp; The roadster triumphed.&nbsp; The old restrictions
were swept away like cobwebs.</p>
<p>Another factor in the silent revolution was the lure of the
Thames.&nbsp; This, indeed, began to call to the jaded senses of
the overworked Londoner at an earlier date than that of the
invitation of the bike.&nbsp; In the early seventies I have
sculled from Kingston up to Sunbury Lock on a Sunday afternoon
without meeting more than a dozen other craft.&nbsp; And during
those same years I have idled between Marlow Bridge and Temple
Lock without encountering a skiff on the whole reach.&nbsp; The
fatuous fisherman, indeed, attached his unwieldy punt to the
ripecks stuck in the river-bed, and invented fish stories while
he waited for the infrequent bite.&nbsp; Save for him the upper
reaches were deserted.&nbsp; The beauties of the river discovered
themselves for him and for the swans.</p>
<p>To-day the Thames has become the River of Pleasure.&nbsp;
Music floats from club lawns; every reach from Richmond up to
Wargrave is joyous with the laughter from skiffs and punts and
launches.&nbsp; The locks, ever filling and emptying, give
entrance and egress to as many river craft on this one day as in
earlier times passed in the whole three hundred and
sixty-five.&nbsp; There is a line of house-boats on nearly every
reach, and from beneath their awnings, white or striped or apple
green, there come the strumming of the banjo and <a
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>the pop of
the champagne cork.&nbsp; On the lawns sloping from week-end
houses to the stream happy groups assemble.&nbsp; The men in
flannels, the girls in white and cream-coloured fabrics, make for
the tennis-courts or for the flotilla moored to the landing-stage
in which the lawn meets the river.&nbsp; Yes; in any attempt to
assign the causes which were instrumental in banishing the
Puritan Sabbath from London, the Thames must be accorded a place
of honour.&nbsp; The Thames first showed the Londoner the way
out.&nbsp; And the motor car continued and extended the
exodus.</p>
<p>It must not be supposed that the old order was permitted to
yield place to new without a word of protest here and
there.&nbsp; Among other of the many remonstrants were the
Reverend and Right Reverend Fathers in God forming the Upper
House of Convocation.&nbsp; The action of this episcopal court
brings me to the point at which the Press touches the question,
and renders this matter of Sunday observance germane to the
general scheme of my book.</p>
<p>Singular as it may appear, the original factor which set the
Upper House of Convocation reflecting on the matter was an
article by Mr. &ldquo;Jimmy&rdquo; Davis in his own paper, the
<i>Bat</i>.&nbsp; That a gentleman of the Jewish faith should
have succeeded in influencing the episcopal chiefs of the English
Christians may, on the first blush of it, appear strange.&nbsp;
But it is not more strange than the other fact that some of those
very Bishops owed their preferment to a Jewish Prime
Minister.&nbsp; The whole incident of Jimmy&rsquo;s
interposition, and its results, make an interesting story, though
a long one, I am afraid.&nbsp; At this juncture, then, let me
address you, who have followed me thus far, in the words that
appear in the middle of the stodgy parts of Carlyle&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Frederick the Great&rdquo;: &ldquo;Courage,
reader!&rdquo;</p>
<p>While freedom was thus making for itself wider boundaries,
Jimmy Davis was very much in the movement.&nbsp; And being in the
movement, he would naturally take an interest in the Pelican
Club, which was the most advanced, unconventional, and at times
rowdy, protest that had so far been made against the tyranny of
Mrs. Grundy.&nbsp; Although I was a member of the Pelican Club
myself, I do not remember <a name="page109"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 109</span>whether Davis was.&nbsp; Nor need I
take the trouble to make inquiries, as the fact does not affect
my narrative.&nbsp; Probably he was <i>not</i>.&nbsp; For the
institution was founded by a gentleman who had at one time been
in his employ in an inferior capacity.&nbsp; Certainly I never
met him on the premises.</p>
<p>The Pelican Club was founded by Mr. Ernest
Wells&mdash;familiarly known as
&ldquo;Swears-and-Swells.&rdquo;&nbsp; Its membership was
composed chiefly of rapid men-about-town, and its principal
functions were given on Sunday nights.&nbsp; These were concerts
at which the comic element preponderated, and boxing contests
conducted in a properly-appointed ring.&nbsp; Suitable premises
were secured in Denman Street, a shy thoroughfare close to
Piccadilly Circus.&nbsp; The place had formerly been used as the
factory of a carriage-builder.&nbsp; The ground-floor was very
spacious and very lofty, and in every way was adapted to its new
purposes.&nbsp; There was a gallery above, off which opened
card-rooms, bedrooms, and other apartments.&nbsp; A bar was
fitted up close to the entrance, and the whole place was soon
transformed into an extremely bright and cheery
institution.&nbsp; Having secured the premises and decided on the
lines on which the institution was to be run, there remained for
the enterprising founder the important question of obtaining
members.</p>
<p>Mr. Wells called in to his assistance Mr. &ldquo;Willie&rdquo;
Goldberg.&nbsp; A word or two concerning that remarkable little
man may not be out of place.&nbsp; John Corlett and Reggie Brooks
were taking a walk one day in the neighbourhood of Maidstone,
when they came on the encouraging spectacle of a small man
sitting by the roadside, and sniggering over the front page of
Corlett&rsquo;s newspaper.&nbsp; The sight was so agreeable and
flattering to the wayfarers that they stopped to inquire into the
exact source of the stranger&rsquo;s mirth.&nbsp; The
conversation thus commenced ended in the engagement of the small
man on the staff of the <i>Pink &rsquo;Un</i>.&nbsp; And it
turned out to be one of the best engagements that Corlett ever
made.&nbsp; Goldberg was a &rsquo;Varsity man, his career at
Oxford having been, if not brilliant, at least much more than
respectable.&nbsp; When he left the University, he obtained a
Government appointment, which, in his own phrase, he
&ldquo;chucked.&rdquo;&nbsp; When encountered <a

on a Kentish highway, he was just idling along.&nbsp; He was a
born Bohemian, and he idled along until the day of his death.</p>
<p>Now, when Goldberg joined Corlett&rsquo;s staff, the paper to
which he was called upon to contribute was the favourite
periodical literature of what constituted the rapid section of
Society.&nbsp; And Goldberg not only catered, in his way, for the
literary thirst of men-about-town, but he became personally
identified with that contingent out of doors.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;Johnnies,&rdquo; the &ldquo;mashers,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;rowdy-dowdy boys,&rdquo; the &ldquo;sports,&rdquo; of the
joyous days made much of him.&nbsp; Indeed, they made so much of
him that he went to his grave a good quarter of a century before
there was any absolute necessity for making that journey.</p>
<p>Here, then, was the man for Ernest Wells.&nbsp; Goldberg was
in a position not only to introduce members, but to
&ldquo;boom&rdquo; the enterprise in the Press.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Willie&rdquo; at first showed himself coy.&nbsp; But the
offer of a share in the concern proved an irresistible
lure.&nbsp; An agreement was drawn up, and the Pelican Club
became the joint property of Ernest Wells and William
Goldberg.&nbsp; The latter gentleman at once set himself to the
task of collecting members.&nbsp; And the collection which he
succeeded in making as a nucleus certainly promised something in
the way of clubs that the West End had yet seen.&nbsp; There were
Major &ldquo;Bob&rdquo; Hope Johnstone, &ldquo;Hughie&rdquo;
Drummond of the Stock Exchange, his brother Archie Drummond of
the Scots Guards, Captain Fred Russell, &ldquo;Billy&rdquo;
Fitzwilliam, the Marquis of Queensberry, &ldquo;Kim&rdquo;
Mandeville (afterwards Duke of Manchester), Arthur Roberts the
comedian, and the brothers Horn&mdash;not the boxers of that
name, but a couple of rich young men.</p>
<p>From such a start the club naturally grew in numbers, and made
for itself exactly the sort of reputation which the proprietors
desired.&nbsp; Denman Street became the liveliest comer in the
swagger end of London.&nbsp; Boxing contests on a Sunday night
hit the imagination of the town.&nbsp; A certain general
curiosity was excited.&nbsp; Membership, which was restricted,
was eagerly sought.&nbsp; The shekels came rolling in.&nbsp; The
Pelican, it was believed, had come to stay.</p>
<p><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>When
the success of the new institution was at its height,
&ldquo;Jimmy&rdquo; Davis contributed to the columns of the
<i>Bat</i> an article on &ldquo;The Sunday Amusements of the
Rich.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of course, the whole thing was conceived in a
mood of extreme cynicism, and Davis wrote the article with his
tongue in his cheek.&nbsp; It was strange enough that Davis
should write such an article.&nbsp; For what, after all, could it
matter to a Jew how the Gentiles amused themselves on a
Sunday?&nbsp; But it was still more strange that an article
appearing in the columns of a paper which did not enjoy the very
sweetest of reputations, should have vexed the righteous minds of
the Episcopal Bench, and caused the subject of
&ldquo;Jimmy&rsquo;s&rdquo; article to be debated in the Upper
House of Convocation.</p>
<p>And it was strange, too&mdash;in its way&mdash;that, when the
debate was set down for hearing, I, a member of the Pelican Club,
should have been deputed by the editor of an evening paper to
attend Convocation, and write a more or less graphic description
of the historic debate.&nbsp; My experience of the Upper House of
Convocation, while assuring me that its members possessed quite a
respectable amount of debating power, also convinced me that
their deliberations were academic merely, and that the Bishops
were terribly out of touch with actualities.&nbsp; The conditions
under which the &ldquo;House&rdquo; sat were not conducive to
those illusions which the laity should cherish regarding the
episcopacy.&nbsp; Their lordships met in a dining-room on the
first-floor of a house in Dean&rsquo;s Yard, Westminster.&nbsp; A
striped wall-paper was adorned at gaping intervals with
engravings from Millais and Landseer.&nbsp; The furniture was
mid-Victorian.&nbsp; A long telescope-table filled the middle of
the room.&nbsp; Round this board sat the Bishops, presided over
by the Archbishop of Canterbury, who took his place at the top of
the table.&nbsp; Had their lordships not been robed in billowing
white, with lawn sleeves, doctors&rsquo; hoods, and decorated
with episcopal signets, the idea conveyed to the mind of the
casual observer would have been that of a group of commercial
travellers assembled in the commercial room of a country hotel
waiting for the one o&rsquo;clock ordinary.&nbsp; In the
embrasure of a window looking out on to Dean&rsquo;s <a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>Yard a
table was placed for the reporters.&nbsp; The general public was,
of course, rigorously excluded.&nbsp; Arrangements were made only
for a certain number of reporters&mdash;six, I think, was the
limit.&nbsp; And it had been necessary to arrange for the absence
of one of these gentlemen, so that I, who unfortunately have
never mastered shorthand, might be present.&nbsp; From my coign
of vantage in the embrasure I could see some Westminster
schoolboys playing in the enclosure.&nbsp; Their shrilling shouts
punctuated the earlier deliberations of their lordships.&nbsp;
Besides ourselves of the Press and the members of the Upper House
of Convocation, the only other person present was Sir John
Hassard, the courteous Registrar.&nbsp; His chief duty seemed to
be that of ushering the gentlemen of the Press in and out of this
hopelessly bourgeois Upper Chamber.&nbsp; And this was a ceremony
of frequent occurrence.&nbsp; When their lordships considered
that the trend of the debate made it desirable that strangers
should retire, the Archbishop looked over to us, smiled
benevolently, and observed: &ldquo;If you please,
gentlemen.&rdquo;&nbsp; It reminded me of Ponsford&rsquo;s early
morning admonition to customers supping late at the Albion.&nbsp;
We rose.&nbsp; Sir John preceded us to the door, opened it, and
bowed us out.&nbsp; Presently&mdash;their lordships having
concluded their private colloquy&mdash;he came out to us in the
passage, and ushered us in again.</p>
<p>To me the surroundings, coupled with the irreverent and openly
familiar attitude of the chief of my colleagues, came as a
shock.&nbsp; I had anticipated that the Upper House would have
sat in some gilded chamber of their own, or perhaps in one of the
chapels of the Abbey.&nbsp; I had imagined myself, as the
representative of the profane vulgar, sitting hidden away in some
lofty gallery.&nbsp; But here I was hobnobbing with the Bishops,
as it were.&nbsp; It was a sense of unsolicited intimacy that
possessed me.&nbsp; And when I reflected that I was one of the
very persons whose conduct was under debate, I had the further
sensation of being a spy in the camp.&nbsp; Mr. Basil Cook, the
chief of the staff reporting in Convocation, was disturbed by
none of these scruples, and when he noticed that a Bishop was
speaking from a written document, he went up to the venerable
orator at the conclusion of his speech, <a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>and boldly
asked him for his notes.&nbsp; In one case, indeed, the intrepid
man seemed to collar the ecclesiastic&rsquo;s notes by force.</p>
<p>Of the debate nothing remains in my memory save the speech of
the Bishop of Winchester.&nbsp; Tall, gaunt, marked down even
then by Death, Harold Browne proved himself intellectually as
well as physically head and shoulders above his brethren.&nbsp;
His words were weighty, well chosen, impressive.&nbsp; His
message was one of grave reproval.&nbsp; He deplored the
introduction of the topic.&nbsp; He warned Convocation of the
danger of registering its views in resolutions of the
House.&nbsp; Resolutions which were foredoomed as inoperative, he
argued, must stultify them as a high deliberative assembly.&nbsp;
But the warnings of My Lord of Winchester fell on deaf
ears.&nbsp; Their lordships were out after the Sunday amusements
of the rich.&nbsp; They were not to be balked of their
sport.&nbsp; They passed their resolutions.&nbsp; And from that
hour the rich have gone on extending the scope and scenes of
their Sunday amusements.</p>
<p>Of my own descriptive account of the proceedings, of course, I
say nothing.&nbsp; But Sala made it the text of one of his
inimitable essays.&nbsp; His comments, I remember, concluded with
these words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may interest these Reverend and Right Reverend
Fathers in God to know that the resolutions which they have just
registered will have about as much influence on the Sunday
amusements of the rich as a similar set of resolutions passed by
the Antediluvian Order of Buffaloes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Very soon indeed the Church discovered that, there being no
hope of stemming the tide, their only chance was to make things
easy and agreeable for those who were borne along by it.&nbsp;
Accommodation for bicycles was announced here and there by a
far-seeing Vicar&mdash;temporarily characterized as a
&ldquo;crank.&rdquo;&nbsp; And in villages down by the banks of
the Thames, Rectors began to intimate that visitors in flannels
were welcome to worship.&nbsp; Sunday clubs multiplied on the
banks of &ldquo;Sweete Temmes.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sunday golf clubs
were established on a thousand links.&nbsp; The introduction of
the automobile has precipitated matters.&nbsp; The word
&ldquo;rest&rdquo; has had appointed to it the only reasonable
interpretation.&nbsp; <a name="page114"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 114</span>And the twentieth century Anno
Domini has definitely declined to be bound any longer by an
enactment forced on a nomadic and unruly crowd by a Jewish leader
who &ldquo;flourished&rdquo; nearly twenty centuries before
Christ.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that this consummation was helped
forward by the ill-advised action of a bench of Bishops.&nbsp;
And it is amusing to remember that their lordships were acting on
the initiative of a man-about-town, of Hebrew extraction, who
personally did not care a cent for the observance either of the
Jewish Sabbath or of the Christian Sunday.</p>
<p>The Pelican Club was not a very long-lived institution.&nbsp;
The founder had not taken into account the gradual nature of all
processes of evolution.&nbsp; He had gone too fast and too
far.&nbsp; There was, indeed, a growing feeling in the public
mind that the observance of Sunday as ordained was
irrational.&nbsp; But the vast majority of those who confessed to
that frame of mind would contend that to watch boxing contests
and listen to comic songs in a hot and crowded arena was a still
more irrational manner of keeping the Sabbath.&nbsp; The movement
was toward outdoor exercise, healthy recreation, fresh air, and
the open road.</p>
<p>When the Pelican Club ceased, it was for a short space
reincarnated as the &ldquo;Barn Club.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
constitution, ownership, and membership, were practically
identical with those of the earlier venture.&nbsp; Here, however,
the building was erected by Wells.&nbsp; He was free from the
demands of a landlord, which in Denman Street had increased in
exact proportion to his own growing prosperity.&nbsp; The new
premises were in Gerrard Street, Soho.&nbsp; And I understand
that the founder made rather a profitable deal when he disposed
of the building to an electric lighting company or to a telephone
company&mdash;which was it?</p>
<p>The name of the Pelican Club still persists in the title of a
theatrical paper conducted by Mr. Frank Boyd.&nbsp; Never before,
I should imagine, was a journalistic success achieved at so small
an expenditure of either brains or capital.&nbsp; But Frank was
ever a canny man; he understood the small public for whom he
catered, gave them, at small cost, what <a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>he
considered good for them, became that enviable personage the
owner of a paying newspaper property, and so continueth even unto
this day.</p>
<p>Boyd sanctified his association with the stage by marrying
Miss Agnes Hewitt, a well-known actress who is understood to
supply her husband with his Society gossip and his latest
fashions.&nbsp; His original ties were rather with the Church
than with the Stage.&nbsp; He was the son of Dr. A. K. H. Boyd,
of St. Andrews, author of &ldquo;The Recreations of a Country
Parson&rdquo;&mdash;the &ldquo;Boyd that writes&rdquo; of
Carlyle&rsquo;s famous sneer.</p>
<p>The passing of the Puritan sabbath has conferred benefits also
on those who are entirely out of sympathy with the new order of
things, and who still patronize the institution of public worship
to the extent of attending church or chapel twice or even thrice
on Sunday.&nbsp; The priests and the pastors have awakened to the
fact that if they would retain their congregations they must give
them bright, cheery services, and sermons which, if not eloquent
or convincing, shall at least be interesting and intelligent.</p>
<p>Huxley flung a gibe at the &ldquo;corybantic
Christianity&rdquo; of General Booth.&nbsp; But &ldquo;corybantic
Christianity&rdquo; has held the proletariat by substituting one
sort of excitement for another.&nbsp; And the great middle
classes can only be kept in leash for a while longer by music and
oratory of a kind which, a century since, our militant Protestant
forbears would surely have regarded as, in themselves, grievous
acts of Sabbath-breaking.</p>
<p>Sabbath-breaking, quotha!&nbsp; The Sabbath set up by the
dour, morose, uncharitable religionists of my childhood has been
broken into bits, nor will all the skilled science of
enthusiastic collectors ever piece it together again.</p>

116</span>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">ODD FISH</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">London</span> streets have been cleared of
their professional &ldquo;odd fish&rdquo; owing to the parental
solicitude of the police.&nbsp; The expensive operations of the
London County Council having swept away all the remnants of
Dickensland, the police have gathered up and carried away any
Dickenesque characters that survived the advent of the reforming
Council.&nbsp; All things considered, our &aelig;diles have acted
wisely in the interests of Londoners.&nbsp; They have gained
experience and confidence.&nbsp; Such early mistakes as the
architecture of Shaftesbury Avenue and Charing Cross Road will
never be repeated.&nbsp; The progress of Kingsway and Aldwych
prove <i>that</i> at all events.&nbsp; If we are to lose the
ancient picturesqueness, we are to have in return spacious
roadways flanked by architectural dignity.</p>
<p>If, however, we rejoice in the erection of palaces on sites
once occupied by rookeries, we must surely sometimes experience a
pang of regret over the disappearance of the eccentric characters
of the town&mdash;the quaint Londoners who made a living out of
their eccentricities or their afflictions.&nbsp; Those of them
who were not removed disappeared, no doubt, owing to natural
causes.&nbsp; But no successor was admitted to have a valid claim
to the vacant place.&nbsp; The streets are clear of mendicant
freaks, and even of those quaint itinerants who performed on the
chance of a public recognition of their exhibitions.&nbsp; Codlin
and Short no longer&mdash;as in the <i>Punch</i> pictures of John
Leech&mdash;set up their stage in West End squares.&nbsp; The man
in soiled tights who released himself from ropes coiled and
knotted by confederates in the crowd <a name="page117"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>is never seen nowadays attempting
his performance in the mouth of a
&ldquo;no-thoroughfare.&rdquo;&nbsp; His dirty fleshings would
scarcely be tolerated even on a race-course.&nbsp; On second
thoughts, I omit him from the odd street characters whom I miss
from the London thoroughfares.</p>
<p>But there should have been someone of his household to carry
on the tradition of the little cripple who used to sit on the
pavement in front of the National Gallery in Trafalgar Square,
making weird noises on a German concertina.&nbsp; Close by, in
the mouth of Suffolk Street, Pall Mall East, a most respectable
young man exhibited a &ldquo;happy family&rdquo; in a large
cage.&nbsp; It was a most instructive lesson in natural history,
and an illustration of the power of man over cats, canaries,
rats, mice, dogs, and other specimens of what are popularly known
as &ldquo;the lower animals,&rdquo; and many a morning have I
stood entranced as I watched a white mouse play with the whiskers
of a cat, or seen a fox-terrier invite the familiarity of an
exceedingly maleficent-looking rodent.&nbsp; There was some
ethical teaching to be picked up also, for no doubt the result
achieved by the showman was entirely the effect of moral
suasion.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is all done by kindness,&rdquo; as the
showman of the circus used to say.</p>
<p>Then there was the old fellow who used to sweep the crossing
at the top of King Street, where it enters St. James&rsquo;s
Square.&nbsp; He was a rubicund customer, whose whole person
seemed to reek of much good ale.&nbsp; He was dressed in the pink
of the hunting-field, and wore the picturesque hunting-cap of the
shires.&nbsp; He could scarcely have been a M.F.H. fallen on evil
times, and haunting the clubland of the days of his vanity.&nbsp;
Perhaps he was a huntsman or a whipper-in grown too fat or too
bibulous for his work.&nbsp; He had certainly selected an
eligible &ldquo;pitch,&rdquo; and must have acquired a nice
competence from the fogeys, old and middle-aged, who used his
crossing.&nbsp; His attractive livery should have
descended&mdash;for I deem the original wearer long since the
victim of another sort of crossing&mdash;to an emulous son.&nbsp;
The world is growing too drab.&nbsp; And even an &aelig;sthetic
crossing-sweeper might do somewhat to improve its colour
scheme.</p>
<p>Do you remember the accomplished harper who made <a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>gay with
his music the old flagged courts of the City?&nbsp; No one
interfered with the performances of that descendant of
David.&nbsp; He was permitted to make music within the sacred
precincts of the courtyard in which stands Rothschild&rsquo;s
famous house in St. Swithin&rsquo;s Lane.&nbsp; It was to this
gracious permission, doubtless, that might be traced the
rumour&mdash;repeated by the credulous sort in the
City&mdash;that this player on stringed instruments was a poor
relation of the financial princes of New Court.&nbsp; Since that
musician was called away, no successor has been permitted to
waken the dulcet echoes of New Court.&nbsp; Nor, indeed, are the
efforts of strolling artists on sackbut or psaltery encouraged in
the obscure byways of the City, a circumstance which is, I think,
to be deplored.</p>
<p>Whenever I visited the City, a merchant who always fascinated
me was one who had a pitch in the opening of a passage at the
eastern end of the Poultry.&nbsp; Alas! the very passage itself
is built over now, and the merchant and his wares have not become
even a part of tradition.&nbsp; I have asked City men about him a
score of times.&nbsp; I have never yet met one who remembers ever
having seen him&mdash;ever having heard of him.&nbsp; They are
the most expert forgetters in the world, are City men.&nbsp; And
it is perhaps as well.&nbsp; A large proportion of the
day&rsquo;s transactions there are best forgotten.&nbsp; The
vanished merchant of the vanished passage had set up a stand on
which he exhibited miniature articles in copper.&nbsp; The goods
were most exquisitely finished, and were perfect
models&mdash;made to scale&mdash;of their originals.&nbsp;
Culinary articles were his chief stock-in-trade&mdash;kettles,
frying-pans, Dutch ovens, dish-covers, coffee-pots,
saucepans&mdash;all beautifully executed, and the largest of them
not more than three inches in diameter.&nbsp; At one time I had
an entire <i>batterie de cuisine</i> bought from him.&nbsp; He,
too, should have had a successor; but possibly a successor might
have found himself flattened out by the stores.</p>
<p>The sleight-of-hand performer has been gently pushed off the
public highways.&nbsp; Him also I regret, and offer what incense
I may to his memory.&nbsp; A smart-looking, precise,
never-in-a-hurry young man, his expression was invariably <a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>pensive,
suspicions, contemptuous.&nbsp; He carried a little round table
with a faded red cloth fixed to it, like that of a card-table,
which indeed, in a way, it was.&nbsp; Ah those delightful
tricks!&nbsp; Cinquevalli and Charles Bertram have since worked
their miracles for my behoof, but they have failed to arouse the
same sensations which the performers of the West End street
corners raised in my ingenuous mind.</p>
<p>Conjurers had sharp tongues, too, and their repartee was ready
and pungent.&nbsp; I was walking down Bedford Street, Strand, one
forenoon with the late Mr. J. L. Toole, the celebrated
comedian.&nbsp; One of these roadside jugglers had set up his
stand near the corner of Maiden Lane.&nbsp; He was performing
some trick with a bottle and a piece of paper.&nbsp; Toole, who
was uncommonly fond of practical joking, pushed through the
little crowd, and, simulating the manner of a person in great
pain and in a great hurry, held out twopence to the magician.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take a pennyworth of your pills and a
pennyworth of your pain-destroyer,&rdquo; he groaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Toole,&rdquo; coolly observed the other,
who had at once recognized the actor, &ldquo;but I make it a rule
never to take money from brother professionals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His little audience laughed, now discovering the identity of
the practical joker.&nbsp; Toole exhibited every outward sign of
delight at the retort, tossed a florin to the victor, and
whispered to me as we went off: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a
dev&rsquo;lish smart chap, don&rsquo;t you know; but he took my
money all the same!&rdquo;&nbsp; I do not think, however, that he
relished the incident any too well.</p>
<p>Barney Barnato commenced his financial career as a peripatetic
conjurer, his beats being in the East, and not in the West End of
the town.&nbsp; And, although I only knew him in the days of his
prosperity, I did not find it difficult to discover in the
millionaire the traces of the ancient calling.&nbsp; And, to do
Barney justice, he was not in the least ashamed of his humble
beginnings.&nbsp; In this he differed considerably from certain
other South African magnates whom I have met.&nbsp; Who persuaded
Barney to build the pretentious, over-ornamented palace in Park
Lane I do not know, but I feel sure it was never undertaken on
his own initiative.</p>
<p><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>There
was one very odd fish who perambulated the Strand in the
seventies.&nbsp; The cut of his clothes&mdash;which were old but
well brushed&mdash;was early Victorian.&nbsp; His light-coloured
hair was divided at the back most mathematically, and a wisp of
it was drawn over each ear after a fashion set by costermongers
and adopted by Lord Ranelagh.&nbsp; He wore his hat cocked over
one ear, and he sported a straw-coloured moustache to match the
hair of his head.&nbsp; His whole appearance was that of a dandy
run to seed.&nbsp; He might have been a forgotten ghost of the
Regency.&nbsp; He carried a Malacca cane with tassels, and behind
him there followed a white poodle.&nbsp; The man and the dog made
one of the features of the Strand.&nbsp; The poodle never left
his master&rsquo;s heels.&nbsp; Hundreds of times have I watched
the pair of them pass along the street.&nbsp; The dandy seemed to
know nobody, nor did anyone ever salute him; yet he was an
intimate part of the show.</p>
<p>There came a day when he made his promenade&mdash;alone.&nbsp;
And he was attired in mourning.&nbsp; Whether he had donned
sables out of respect for the memory of his canine friend I
cannot say, but the dog was dead and the man was in
mourning.&nbsp; Shortly after this the buck of the Regency
himself disappeared.&nbsp; Then inquiries were made.&nbsp; The
dandy was dead.&nbsp; He had lodged in Westminster.&nbsp; He was
a half-pay Major, and, except that he dressed oddly and clipped
and groomed his poodle with his own hands, he appears to have had
few eccentricities.&nbsp; His landlady wept as she spoke of
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;My dear gentleman&rdquo; she called him, and
she had a hundred and one stories to relate of his kindly
disposition, his practical benevolence, and his racial
pride.&nbsp; He was a Scotsman.</p>
<p>Of the same period as that of the Scots Major was Kitty, the
old Irish flower-seller.&nbsp; Kitty was about seventy years old
when I first made her acquaintance.&nbsp; She perambulated the
north side of the Strand, her beat being bounded by the old
Gaiety Theatre on the east, and by the Adelphi on the west.&nbsp;
She was a &ldquo;character.&rdquo;&nbsp; She knew nearly all her
customers by name, though how she acquired the information the
Lord only knows.&nbsp; &ldquo;Witty Kitty&rdquo; she was called,
<a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>and not
without good reason.&nbsp; I was standing one day on the step of
the <i>Globe</i> office, talking to Henri Van Laun, the friend
and translator of Taine.&nbsp; Kitty came up to us with her
basket of sweet-smelling wares.&nbsp; Van Laun, who hated an
interruption while in the act of unwinding one of his
interminable yarns, motioned her away with a cross word and an
angry gesture.&nbsp; Van Laun was a Jew who had the national
characteristics very severely marked in nose and lips and
complexion.&nbsp; Kitty did not at once accept her dismissal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, buy one for the love o&rsquo; God!&rdquo; she
persisted.</p>
<p>Van Laun turned on her.&nbsp; He was professedly an agnostic,
and fond of airing the fact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no!&nbsp; Who is zis Almighty zat I should buy for
love of him?&nbsp; Hey?&rdquo; he queried fiercely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Och, sir,&rdquo; said Kitty, in sad, reproachful
accents, &ldquo;an&rsquo; is it pretendin&rsquo; not to know Him
you are&mdash;an&rsquo; you wan of His <i>chosen</i>
people!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The calculated accent on the &ldquo;chosen&rdquo; was
delightful.&nbsp; From that day Van Laun became one of
&ldquo;Witty Kitty&rsquo;s&rdquo; most profitable customers.</p>
<p>Human freaks are now steadily discouraged by the police.&nbsp;
But in an earlier time men and women were permitted to parade
their afflictions or deformities in the London
thoroughfares.&nbsp; There was a horrible cripple who used to
propel himself about Trafalgar Square and its vicinity.&nbsp;
Apparently his motive power was confined to his arms.&nbsp; His
progress along the side-paths was like that of a seal.&nbsp; He
was attired in a white nautical suit; he had big round eyes which
he rolled about in the most curious way.&nbsp; Women were much
frightened on beholding him for the first time, and I suspect him
of having been an arrant impostor.&nbsp; Then there was the old
lady who perambulated Whitehall, the top of her head pointing to
the pavement.&nbsp; She was bent literally double.&nbsp; I once
saw Mr. Gladstone (I mean, of course, the eminent man of that
name) stop and address her and give her a coin.&nbsp; The Grand
Old Man had a great taste for curios and antiquities.&nbsp; The
one-armed sailor&mdash;he carries the other down his
side&mdash;and the one-legged mill hand have been relegated to
the suburbs, and even there <a name="page122"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 122</span>they have become discredited, I
think.&nbsp; And as to the miserable wretches who used to exhibit
their sores and open wounds, a public that liberally supports
hospitals won&rsquo;t tolerate any more of that sort around.</p>
<p>But while I have been recalling a few of the odd fish who
frequented the thoroughfares in the quarters of the town most
affected by gentlemen of the Press, I have been somehow conscious
all the time that, however interesting the recollections may be,
they are scarcely of the particular type of odd fish which I set
out to describe.&nbsp; My intention was&mdash;and is&mdash;to
recall some of the eccentric persons on the Press, or those
eccentrics with whom the Press brought me into contact.&nbsp; To
that task I now address myself.</p>
<p>One of the queerest fish of my time was Mr. William Henry
Bingham-Cox.&nbsp; He was a tall, swarthy man&mdash;swarthy,
indeed, is euphemistic, for the man was as copper-coloured as a
Hindu.&nbsp; He had big lips and a head of curly black
hair.&nbsp; The tar-brush had at some time played an important
place in his evolution.&nbsp; He had at one stage of his career
been a clerk in the Bank of England.&nbsp; On inheriting a
certain legacy, he threw up his appointment in Threadneedle
Street, and bought a paper&mdash;then in very low
water&mdash;entitled <i>The Licensed Victuallers&rsquo;
Gazette</i>.&nbsp; He seemed from the first to be able to
interest &ldquo;the trade,&rdquo; and greatly increased the
advertising income of his purchase.&nbsp; It was not, however,
until he conceived the happy idea of publishing bright and
cleverly-written accounts of old prize-fights that the
<i>Gazette</i> began to feel its feet and to make big strides in
the favour of the public.</p>
<p>Although Bingham-Cox was believed by many of his
contemporaries to be as mad as Bedlam, there was a certain method
in his madness.&nbsp; He had the <i>savvee</i> to see that the
new edition of the old fights must be of some literary
excellence, that the stories must be retold with a graphic force
and without a nauseating repetition of the worn-out
<i>clich&eacute;s</i> which, strangely enough, gave relish to the
original accounts when, years before, they appeared in the
columns of <i>Bell&rsquo;s Life</i>.&nbsp; His first selection
was a fortunate one.&nbsp; Sydney French was the chosen historian
of the &ldquo;fancy.&rdquo;&nbsp; He <a name="page123"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 123</span>approached the subject with an open
mind, for he had never seen a fight and knew nothing of the
prize-ring.&nbsp; But he was an all-round journalist, and could
produce a readable column of copy on almost any given topic
within the hour.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Dean could write well about a
broomstick!&rdquo; exclaimed Stella.&nbsp; That was the sort of
journalist French was.&nbsp; He could write well&mdash;that is to
say, in an interesting way&mdash;about a broomstick.&nbsp; He was
not always what you might call <i>on</i> his subject.&nbsp; But
he was always somewhere round about it.&nbsp; And he was never
dull.&nbsp; He kept on at the fights until his death.&nbsp;
French was on the staff of the <i>Dispatch</i>, and found the Cox
engagement a very nice addition to his income.&nbsp; The
honorarium for the fight article ranged from seven to ten guineas
a week.</p>
<p>When French died, Bingham-Cox was in despair.&nbsp; Many men
had a &ldquo;try&rdquo; at the game.&nbsp; But it was not as easy
as it looked.&nbsp; Man after man was found wanting.&nbsp; Among
others who took a hand at the task was Mr. T. P. O&rsquo;Connor,
now M.P. for the Scotland Division of Liverpool.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tay
Pay&rdquo; has a fine roving style of his own, but was apparently
unequal to the Homeric strain essential in the epic of the
Ring.&nbsp; Willmott Dixon was sent for, and for many years he
was not only the writer of the prize-fights, but editor of the
paper.&nbsp; French was bad to beat, but Dixon beat him, and beat
him easily.&nbsp; Dixon had a knowledge of the Ring; he could
&ldquo;put up his dukes&rdquo; himself, thoroughly enjoyed
&ldquo;a bit of a scrap,&rdquo; and his Cambridge experiences
stood him in good stead.&nbsp; His memory, too, was rarely at
fault.&nbsp; I never met a journalist so independent of books of
reference.</p>
<p>Bingham-Cox was a great theatre-goer.&nbsp; His widowed sister
kept house for him over the offices of the paper in Southampton
Street, Strand.&nbsp; She usually accompanied her brother on
these outings, and, though his paper had no recognized position
in the theatrical world, &ldquo;William Henry&rdquo; used to
besiege the acting-managers for stalls and boxes.&nbsp; When he
succeeded in capturing a couple of free seats he was as pleased
as Punch, although they usually cost him three or four times
their market price, for he invariably indicated his appreciation
of the manager&rsquo;s civility by <a name="page124"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 124</span>sending him a box of cigars.&nbsp;
As the cigars were generally &ldquo;Flor de Cuba&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Caba&ntilde;as&rdquo; of a famous crop, one may imagine
that acting-managers were not unwilling to oblige him if they
could.&nbsp; The strange man did not smoke himself, and was
horrified if anyone came smoking into his office.</p>
<p>Occasionally he contributed to his own columns.&nbsp; His
contributions were usually of a more or less libellous
nature.&nbsp; He called me in on one occasion to advise about the
opening paragraph of a short dramatic notice which he had
written.&nbsp; The thing was in proof.&nbsp; It dealt with a play
by Sims and Buchanan called &ldquo;The English Rose.&rdquo;&nbsp;
From the tone of the essay I inferred that the eccentric
proprietor had been unsuccessful in getting free stalls at the
Adelphi, where the play had been produced.&nbsp; The paragraph
about which he seemed particularly anxious was the opening
one.&nbsp; It ran in this way:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the most extraordinary production we have ever
been invited to witness.&nbsp; It is an Irish melodrama.&nbsp; It
is entitled &lsquo;The English Rose.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is written
by a Scotsman and a Jew, and it has been put on the stage by two
gentlemen of Swiss nationality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of it?&rdquo; he exclaimed, grinning
and showing his gleaming white teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you are wrong about your facts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He glared at me, exposed his teeth more than ever, stuck his
thumbs in the armholes of his waistcoat, and asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! what!&nbsp; Wrong in my facts!&nbsp; Nonsense, my
friend, nonsense!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the most material statement you are wrong,&rdquo; I
persisted; &ldquo;for Buchanan is not a Scotsman, and Sims is not
a Jew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he cried, grinning more fiercely,
&ldquo;then it&rsquo;s not a libel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s as may be,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;for to my
mind the law of libel resolves itself into this: Whether twelve
men on their oaths consider that the words published by A have
injured B.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went to his desk, initialled the galley, rang the bell, and
handed the slip to the man answering the summons, with the <a
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>intimation:
&ldquo;For the printer.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, turning to me, he said
defiantly: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let it go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether it ever <i>did</i> go I never inquired.&nbsp; The
reminiscence comes back to me unbidden.&nbsp; It had clean
vanished from my memory from that day to this.</p>
<p>He was constantly&mdash;but, as I believe, quite
unconsciously&mdash;giving offence to all sorts and conditions of
men.&nbsp; His black beard, curly hair, gleaming teeth, and
fierce grin, obtained for him an offensive sobriquet thus
bestowed: One of his contributors sent him a letter resigning his
position on the staff.&nbsp; He alleged but one reason for this
course.&nbsp; It was: &ldquo;I can no longer put up with the
antics of a Barbary ape.&rdquo;&nbsp; The eccentric recipient of
the letter, instead of putting it into the fire and forgetting
all about it, assembled the members of the staff, and read the
document as though it proved the hopeless insanity of the
writer.&nbsp; Having read it, he ran round the room, pretending
to scratch his arms after the manner of a caged monkey, uttering
the most comical squeals and chattering his teeth no end.</p>
<p>He was drawn over the incident by Pottinger Stephens, who was
running a weekly called <i>The Topical Times</i>.&nbsp; In that
smart little journal a question was asked the following week in
these words: &ldquo;When did Mr. Bingham-Cox receive the degree
of B.A.?&rdquo;&nbsp; The unfortunate man did not see what lay
under the inquiry.&nbsp; He wrote a letter on the note-paper of
the Junior Athen&aelig;um&mdash;the &ldquo;Junior Prigs,&rdquo;
as it used to be called&mdash;explaining that he had dispensed
with the advantages of a University training, and that he was not
a B.A.&nbsp; The letter appeared in Pot&rsquo;s paper in due
course; but with this heading: &ldquo;<i>Mr. Bingham-Cox denies
that he is a B.A.</i>&rdquo;&nbsp; The person of the newspaper
proprietor was less sacrosanct in the jocund days than in these
greyer times.</p>
<p>Bingham-Cox was a collector in his way.&nbsp; He was very keen
on engravings, and was by no means a bad judge.&nbsp; He started
on his hobby long before the &ldquo;engraving craze&rdquo; set
in, and his collection became worth four or five times the price
he gave for it.&nbsp; The first-floor above the office was full
of his samples from floor to ceiling.&nbsp; One day when <a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>I was
looking over the gallery in his company, he invited me to select
a couple of the engravings.&nbsp; I chose two&mdash;by no means
the least valuable in the collection&mdash;and was about to ask
when I might send for them, when he whipped out a notebook, and
saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave them to you in my will,&rdquo;
made an elaborate pretence of recording the incident.&nbsp; He
was a collector of musical instruments, and had a piano or an
American organ on every landing in the house.&nbsp; The most
intolerable trials to which he subjected his friends were his
recitals on one or other of these instruments.&nbsp; As he
crashed out his Masses and fugues he rolled his head, showed his
teeth, and grinned awfully, as though he thoroughly enjoyed
witnessing the torture he inflicted.</p>
<p>The end of his story is a mingling of tragedy and
comedy.&nbsp; He sold his paper.&nbsp; During the years in which
he had conducted it he always &ldquo;lived over the
shop.&rdquo;&nbsp; He could never have spent a fourth part of his
net profits, and the balance had been well and luckily
invested.&nbsp; When he received the purchase money for the
<i>Gazette</i> and left Southampton Street, he was worth
considerably over &pound;100,000.&nbsp; When he crossed the
threshold of his old offices his astuteness and his luck seem to
have deserted him.&nbsp; He bought a brewery in St. Albans, where
he had a house.&nbsp; From the first this venture was foredoomed
to failure.&nbsp; He became the prospective Unionist candidate
for the division.&nbsp; But Captain Middleton and the Central
Office would have nothing to do with him, and ran a candidate of
their own against him.&nbsp; Bingham-Cox persisted, and actually
went to the poll.&nbsp; At this period I became more intimately
associated with the eccentric man.&nbsp; I made some speeches for
him, and even canvassed the independent electors.&nbsp; More than
once during the campaign I thought it my duty to inform him that
his methods, should he be elected, must insure his being unseated
on petition.&nbsp; He only bared his teeth at the
suggestion.&nbsp; He was quite sure of winning, and he was
equally sure that there would be no petition.</p>
<p>One of my trials in accompanying him was being obliged to
drive about with him in a little village cart, painted a vivid
green, and drawn by a big black donkey.&nbsp; The <a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>candidate,
with his swarthy face, grizzly beard, and fierce expression,
might have been the <i>avant-courier</i> of some travelling
show.&nbsp; The little villagers evidently accepted him as
something of the sort, and accompanied the strange vehicle and
its grinning occupant in and out of their hamlets with joyful
&ldquo;whoops.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was badly beaten at the
polls.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t believe that even the well-bribed
employ&eacute;s in the brewery voted for him.&nbsp; Then the
brewery itself went smash, and Bingham-Cox returned to
Southampton Street (the new owners of the paper having found less
expensive premises), and recommenced life as a newspaper
proprietor.</p>
<p>His new paper was called <i>The Rocket</i>.&nbsp; His idea was
to give the public a <i>Truth</i> for a penny.&nbsp; The title
was an ill-omened one.&nbsp; The paper went up like the explosive
after which it was named, and came down like the stick.&nbsp; He
sent for Clement Scott, and instructed him to write an article
dealing abusively with stage-players.&nbsp; Clemmy agreed
provided his name was kept a profound secret.&nbsp; Bingham-Cox
promised.&nbsp; The worthy man had probably suffered from some
further slight at the hands of the managers.&nbsp; &ldquo;Cut
&rsquo;em up!&nbsp; Slash &rsquo;em!&nbsp; Flay &rsquo;em
alive!&rdquo; he exclaimed to the accommodating
contributor.&nbsp; Scott, secure in his anonymity, proceeded to
cut up, slash, and flay, the unfortunate mummers in a strain of
pious indignation that was peculiarly his own.&nbsp; The article
duly appeared with Clement Scott&rsquo;s name in large letters
both at the top and bottom of it.&nbsp; Scott never really got
over the incident, and his reproaches had no effect on his
employer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Breach of faith indeed!&nbsp; Why, you
have broken faith with a whole profession!&rdquo; was the only
satisfaction he could get from his betrayer.</p>
<p>The <i>Rocket</i> was a failure from the first.&nbsp; It
stopped for want of funds.&nbsp; For the unfortunate man had been
drained dry.&nbsp; Even the engravings and the musical
instruments had gone.&nbsp; In a few short years his fortune had
melted.&nbsp; He was overdrawn at the bank; he had not a cent in
the world.&nbsp; One morning the word went round that he had been
found dead in bed, and there was no inquest.</p>
<p>Arthur T. Pask was a name with which the public became <a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>acquainted
in the eighties.&nbsp; He wrote in Christmas numbers, annuals,
and story magazines.&nbsp; He had established relations with the
<i>Standard</i>, and used to write &ldquo;turn-overs&rdquo; for
that journal.&nbsp; His copy always appeared to me to be devoid
of merit, but personally he was a most interesting man.&nbsp; He
was engaged in the Affidavit Department of the Royal Courts of
Justice.&nbsp; One would have imagined that in that office he
would come across plenty of material for his fictions.&nbsp; He
preferred, however, to evolve these from his inner consciousness,
and to this end he appeared to live in a set of circumstances of
his own invention.&nbsp; At one time he became subject to the
hallucination that he kept a yacht.&nbsp; He appeared in Fleet
Street one day in the most weird sort of nautical rig.&nbsp; With
his yachting cap, white shoes, and reefer jacket with brass
buttons, he had the appearance of the steward of a penny
steamer.&nbsp; He breathed a sea-air.&nbsp; His conversation was
of the &ldquo;Royal Squadron&rdquo;; his similes were drawn from
out the vasty deep.&nbsp; He had acquired something of the roll
of the mariner, and his acquaintances humoured him in his
delusion, and, if they laughed, Arthur himself also was perfectly
happy.&nbsp; One of his nautical impromptus uttered by him during
this phase has remained with me.&nbsp; We began discussing a
comet then due in the heavens, and were talking the customary
foolishness about the chances of that heavenly body striking the
earth.&nbsp; Pask was equal to the occasion and ready with an
expedient.&nbsp; &ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; he exclaimed breezily,
&ldquo;we must throw out cork-fenders over our lee
bow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A remarkable figure in those Fleet Street days was that of a
man who was known by two nicknames, and whose real name appeared
to have been quite forgotten.&nbsp; He was tall and thin, had a
broken nose, a small stubbly moustache, and had acquired the
peculiarly disagreeable habit of addressing every person with
whom he had business as &ldquo;Cocky.&rdquo;&nbsp; This curious
person had originally been a baker in Fetter Lane.&nbsp; But
while his hands were busy in the bakehouse, his heart was in the
race-course, and when his batch of bread was out of the oven and
in the baskets of the distributors, the honest tradesman was off
to the <a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span>terminus to catch a train to Newmarket or Doncaster or
Epsom.&nbsp; He became as well known on the race-course as Steele
or the Duke of Westminster or John Porter.&nbsp; And the nickname
bestowed on him&mdash;it originated in the Ring, no
doubt&mdash;was &ldquo;the Flying Baker.&rdquo;&nbsp; There
could, of course, be but one end to a sporting career of the
kind.&nbsp; As Dick Dunn once said to him, not unkindly,
&ldquo;You should be bakin&rsquo; &rsquo;em, not backin&rsquo;
&rsquo;em!&rdquo;&nbsp; But no backer ever takes that sort of
advice; he has so much faith in his own good luck, coupled with
his sound knowledge of a handicap, that he keeps on to the
end&mdash;the invariably bitter end.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Flying
Baker&rdquo; had hoped to break the Ring, but the Ring broke the
&ldquo;Flying Baker.&rdquo;&nbsp; The hungry creditors refused to
be satisfied by bread alone.&nbsp; The unfortunate victim went
through the Court, and Fleet Street and Fetter Lane knew him no
more&mdash;for a time.</p>
<p>After a space of years he reappeared in his old haunts.&nbsp;
He had obtained a post on one of the sporting papers.&nbsp;
Whether he was on the editorial staff, or in the publishing
department, or a mere messenger, I do not know.&nbsp; He came
round to chambers with a note for me one day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want an answer to this, Cocky,&rdquo; he
observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a bit familiar, don&rsquo;t you
think?&rdquo; I ventured to remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What say, Cocky?&rdquo; he inquired, with the most
innocent air in the world.</p>
<p>I considered it unadvisable to pursue the conversation.&nbsp;
I wrote my reply to the note he had delivered, and handed it to
him without a word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, so long, Cocky!&rdquo; he said as he shambled
off.</p>
<p>In this reincarnation of his he was known in Fleet Street as
&ldquo;Newman Noggs.&rdquo;&nbsp; His real name need not be
recorded here, as it is borne to-day by a son who has risen to
considerable eminence in one of the artistic professions.</p>

130</span>CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="GutSmall">MORE ODD FISH</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">My</span> odd fish should have been
disposed of in a single chapter, but one has lingered over the
memory of them.&nbsp; After all, they contributed the comic
element&mdash;or some of it&mdash;to many hours that lapsed in
laughter.&nbsp; And shall one not be grateful to them or to their
memories?</p>
<p>A considerable proportion of my Press work had to do with the
theatres.&nbsp; I was acquainted with most of the actors and
managers of my time, and some of the oddest fish that ever swam
into my ken were connected with the &ldquo;profession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was, for instance.&nbsp; William Duck&mdash;manager,
theatre-owner, impresario.&nbsp; Duck commenced life in some very
humble capacity in the West of England.&nbsp; By a practice of
punctuality, civility, a strict attention to business, and the
other virtues which are supposed to furnish forth the complete
British tradesman, he became a music-seller and purveyor of
musical instruments.&nbsp; In this capacity he evolved, by easy
stages, into a booker of theatre seats.&nbsp; And although Duck
would not know a good play from a bad one, he saw in the theatre
an easy way to fortune.&nbsp; He felt his feet by dabbling a
little as &ldquo;sharer&rdquo; in likely ventures.&nbsp; But he
found himself, and, incidentally, founded his fortune, when,
acting alone, he purchased the country rights of &ldquo;Our
Boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How much Duck netted out of that most diverting comedy I
cannot say; but I know that it was a prodigious sum.&nbsp; When
first the money came tumbling in, the happy man built him a
lordly pleasure-house.&nbsp; In his new mansion there were
prominent two works of art: a statue of William Shakespeare and a
life-size portrait of Henry Byron.&nbsp; But, <a
name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>of the two,
Duck always considered the author of &ldquo;Our Boys&rdquo; to be
the greater genius.&nbsp; He thought no end of the writer of the
play that brought him his first really big returns.&nbsp; I met
him, in deep mourning, a short time after Byron&rsquo;s
death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, sir,&rdquo; he said, shaking his head,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll never see another man like him&mdash;not in
<i>our</i> time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Byron took every advantage of his admirer&rsquo;s
infatuation.&nbsp; Anything that Byron brought him in the shape
of a play Duck bought.&nbsp; When Duck followed his idol to the
Elysian Fields, his executors came upon a whole press full of
Byron manuscripts which were little more than
&ldquo;dummies.&rdquo;&nbsp; Byron had parted with his birthright
for a mess of pottage, and considered that he was justified in
thus getting back a bit of his own.</p>
<p>Becoming interested in productions running at one or two of
the West End houses, Duck was now frequently to be met &ldquo;in
front,&rdquo; and became known to members of the Press.&nbsp; He
was an exceedingly common-looking man, and one of his eyes always
oozed moisture, which caused him to raise his handkerchief to his
face while he conversed&mdash;a habit which acquaintances at
first found a little disconcerting.&nbsp; He was extremely
ignorant&mdash;or, to speak by the cards, extremely
uneducated&mdash;and he never employed an aspirate except when it
was absolutely unnecessary.&nbsp; Which reminds me of a
story.</p>
<p>When &ldquo;Our Boys&rdquo; was being played for the first
time at Plymouth, Duck recollected having heard Byron say that he
had never visited that town; so he wired to his favourite author
to come down as his guest.&nbsp; Byron wired his
acceptance.&nbsp; He probably had a new bundle of manuscript to
pass on to his patron.&nbsp; Duck was at the station to meet the
traveller with a programme for the afternoon&rsquo;s
enjoyment.&nbsp; He was anxious, above all things, that Byron
should see Plymouth&rsquo;s famous Hoe.&nbsp; So, when they had
exchanged the customary civilities, Duck explained:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m agoin&rsquo; to take you round to see the
sights; an&rsquo; fust of all I think we&rsquo;d better take a
little stroll round the &rsquo;O!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think,&rdquo; asked Byron,
fixing him through his monocle, &ldquo;that first of all
we&rsquo;d better take a little stroll round the H?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Duck looked amazed at his guest.&nbsp; He had not the remotest
idea of the point of Byron&rsquo;s joke.&nbsp; He felt, in his
confused way, that &ldquo;&rsquo;Enery Byron was gittin&rsquo; at
&rsquo;im.&rdquo;&nbsp; He smiled feebly, shook his head in
modest deprecation, and answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ar, you <i>will</i> &rsquo;ave your little joke,
sir; but it ain&rsquo;t the haitch after all, it&rsquo;s the
&rsquo;O we&rsquo;re agoin&rsquo; to see&mdash;the
&rsquo;O.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O!&rdquo; was Byron&rsquo;s monosyllabic comment.</p>
<p>William Duck had in his company as &ldquo;leading man&rdquo; a
capital actor named Edward George.&nbsp; Much of the success of
&ldquo;Our Boys&rdquo; in the provinces was due to the admirable
impersonation of Perkyn Middlewick by that excellent
comedian.&nbsp; While on tour, and playing in one of the large
towns in the North, an admirer of George presented him with a
cameo pin, having the likeness of Lord Byron carved on it.&nbsp;
Duck, who noticed everything, and who had twice as much curiosity
as an old woman, seeing the pin in the scarf of the comedian,
immediately said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty pin, Mr. George!&nbsp; &rsquo;Ad it giv&rsquo;
to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a present,&rdquo; admitted the actor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anybody&rsquo;s portrait?&nbsp; Hey, Mr.
George?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a portrait of Byron,&rdquo; was
the reply.</p>
<p>Duck started, came nearer to George, held his face close to
the cameo, and then fell back laughing consumedly.&nbsp; When he
had succeeded in controlling his merriment, he exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve bin took in, my dear feller:
<i>&rsquo;tain&rsquo;t a bit like &rsquo;im</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>William Duck, you see, knew of only one Byron.&nbsp; And that
was &ldquo;H. J.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Byron&rsquo;s play had run under Duck&rsquo;s management
for five hundred nights in the provinces, the grateful manager
thought that he would like to celebrate the event, and testify to
his appreciation of the efforts put forth by the members of his
company.&nbsp; It was, if I remember aright, in Liverpool that
the play achieved its five hundredth night.&nbsp; Duck&rsquo;s
idea was to give a supper at his hotel.&nbsp; &ldquo;Comes
cheaper &rsquo;n a lunching,&rdquo; one hears him say.&nbsp; He
also determined&mdash;<a name="page133"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 133</span>it must have cost him a pang, for
William was mean, and that&rsquo;s the truth&mdash;to give a
little present to each member of the cast.&nbsp; He purchased
some cheap bangles for the ladies, and a &ldquo;charm&rdquo; of
more or less precious metal for the watch-guards of each of the
gentlemen.</p>
<p>The memorable night arrived.&nbsp; Duck took the chair,
presiding with rustic geniality over the pleased, and indeed
surprised, comedians.&nbsp; Supper at an end, Duck hammered for
silence, and rose, amid cheers, to make the speech of the
evening.&nbsp; He told the devoted band of players what a lot he
thought of them, how their efforts had helped the success of the
comedy, and, in a word, how tremendously pleased he was with
affairs generally.&nbsp; He concluded his address in the
following peroration:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, ladies and gentlemen, them&rsquo;s mere
words.&nbsp; I wished to present everyone &rsquo;ere a solid
token of my feelin&rsquo;s, so I &rsquo;ave determined to give
each member of my company a little momentum of the occasion. . .
.&nbsp; Waiter!&rdquo; he called out to the smiling attendant,
&ldquo;bring in them momentums!&rdquo;</p>
<p>H. J. Byron, in pre-Duckian days, added to the joys of the
town by inventing &ldquo;malaprops,&rdquo; which he used to put
into the mouth of poor Mrs. Swanborough, of the Strand
Theatre.&nbsp; But the advent of Duck put an end to that branch
of industry as far as Byron was concerned.&nbsp; Duck found his
own &ldquo;malaprops,&rdquo; and in their presence the pale
contrivances of the wit were &ldquo;As moonlight is to sunlight
or as water is to wine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the way, I would like to say here, in justice to an amiable
lady long since dead, that Mrs. Swanborough was not at all the
sort of person that the Byron anecdotes make her out to be.&nbsp;
I was for years acquainted with her, and I never knew her to be
guilty of such solecisms as the &ldquo;H. J.&rdquo; series put to
her account.</p>
<p>The banquet and the presentation of &ldquo;momentums&rdquo;
exhausted Duck&rsquo;s capabilities in the direction of
hospitality and largesse; for he was penurious above all things,
and desperately thrifty.&nbsp; In the drawing-room scene in
&ldquo;Our Boys,&rdquo; the stage directions provide for a
chandelier in the centre of the ceiling.&nbsp; In the London
production this <a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>was ablaze every night with wax candles.&nbsp; The
first night on tour, the property-master had provided candles on
the original scale.&nbsp; Duck nearly had a fit when he saw the
illumination.&nbsp; He summoned the property-man to his office,
and&mdash;<i>both</i> eyes now shedding tears&mdash;he ordered
that in future the candles be reduced in number by one half, and
those that were used to be cut in four pieces.&nbsp; The
expression of the property-man was one of mingled distress and
contempt.&nbsp; Observing which, Duck, wiping his eyes, observed
with a smile:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The shorter they har, the longer they&rsquo;ll
last.&nbsp; See?&nbsp; Hey?&rdquo;&nbsp; I suspect he saw, for he
spat on the carpet; and made his exit without a word.</p>
<p>I remember another London manager who was before Duck&rsquo;s
time, and who possessed some of his peculiarities.&nbsp; This was
Giovanelli, who engaged in theatrical and other entertainments in
the east and north of the town.&nbsp; How this extraordinary
individual came by the name Giovanelli I never knew.&nbsp; He was
a Cockney Jew, with all the engaging characteristics of that
delightful hybrid.&nbsp; His friends called him &ldquo;Jo&rdquo;
for short.&nbsp; He had seen the world, had Giovanelli.&nbsp;
Among other places which he had visited was Australia.&nbsp; It
was on returning from that colony, I think, he adopted the
rolling Italian name which he bore in after-life.&nbsp; What name
he went out in is one of those interesting facts lost to the
annals of the stage.</p>
<p>Besides running a theatre in the East End, the versatile
&ldquo;Jo&rdquo; acted as a low comedian.&nbsp; He did not,
however, quite fancy himself in the dual role of actor-manager,
and neither, indeed, did the public.&nbsp; Therefore he always
engaged a low comedian in his company to supplement his own
efforts in that line.&nbsp; Indeed, the low comedian was the most
important member of East End companies, the &ldquo;comic
relief&rdquo; in melodrama being greatly to the taste of the
untutored patrons.&nbsp; &ldquo;Jo&rdquo; once engaged an actor
who seemed to go all right at rehearsal, but who on the first
night excited the sibilation of &ldquo;the bird.&rdquo;&nbsp; At
the end of the performance Giovanelli sent for him.&nbsp; He
handed him some golden coins.</p>
<p><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s your week&rsquo;s salary, my
boy.&nbsp; You needn&rsquo;t come again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I demand your reason for this summary dismissal,&rdquo;
said the chagrined performer, standing greatly on his
dignity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Giovanelli, shrugging his shoulders,
&ldquo;if you <i>will</i> &rsquo;ave it&mdash;it&rsquo;s because
you&rsquo;re a dam bad low comedian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what price <i>you</i> as a comedian?&rdquo;
exclaimed the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, I know, my boy,&rdquo; replied Giovanelli, in
his oily, deprecating way; &ldquo;but, you see, the public
won&rsquo;t stand <i>two</i> dam bad low comedians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some time since I saw in the Death advertisements of the
<i>Times</i> an announcement of the decease of Mr. Richard
Barnard.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dick&rdquo; Barnard was one of the most
impenetrable mysteries of the Strand.&nbsp; He was always well
dressed; he posed as a racing man, as a journalist, as a
<i>fl&acirc;neur</i>.&nbsp; He managed to procure first-night
invitations to all the important premiers.&nbsp; He had scraped
an acquaintance with some of the best-known men on the turf, and
was hand-in-glove with theatrical managers.&nbsp; The major
portion of his time was spent in Romano&rsquo;s bar.&nbsp; But,
for all his pose, Barnard never owned a race-horse, never was a
journalist, never had the slightest interest in the stage.&nbsp;
His success was founded on a well-groomed person, a supercilious
manner, the judicious communication of any good racing
information that came his way, and&mdash;indomitable cheek.&nbsp;
For Dick was an adventurer pure and simple, having abandoned the
career of billiard-marker in Birmingham for the greater
possibilities of the Metropolis.</p>
<p>Like most of his kidney, his life was a series of financial
&ldquo;ups and downs.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sometimes he was full of
money; as often he was stony-broke.&nbsp; It was during one of
these latter periods that he was sitting in &ldquo;the
Roman&rsquo;s&rdquo; lonely and disconsolate.&nbsp; To him
entered, like a ray of sunshine, a man-about-town in his little
way, a votary of the drama, and an habitu&eacute; of
Romano&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He was one of those, also, who took Dick
Barnard seriously, supposing him to be a person of great
influence on the Turf, the Stage, and in Society.</p>
<p>Dick brightened up at the advent of his friend, but, of
course, <a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>he did not evince any particular elation.&nbsp; His
satisfaction was naturally enhanced when the young man from the
country invited him to lunch.</p>
<p>Barnard accepted in the manner of a man who was conferring a
favour.&nbsp; They went into the narrow dining-saloon behind the
bar&mdash;that was the only <i>salle &agrave; manger</i> Romano
boasted in his halcyon days&mdash;and ordered luncheon for two
from Otto the waiter.&nbsp; During lunch Barnard related such
items of news as he thought would interest.&nbsp; And in return
for these bits of scandal his friend told him that he had just
been down in the Boro&rsquo; selling his father&rsquo;s crop of
hops, and that he was carrying home the spoils in his
note-case&mdash;spoils amounting to several hundred pounds.&nbsp;
To a man who had not fingered a banknote for a month of Sundays
this was news indeed.</p>
<p>They did themselves fairly well&mdash;as well as a bill of
fifteen shillings will allow two lunchers to do themselves at
&ldquo;the Roman&rsquo;s.&rdquo;&nbsp; When coffee had been
served, and the lofty-minded Otto had gone to take orders from
another customer, the young gentleman leaned across the table,
and whispered to Barnard:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pass you a tenner under the table; please
pay the bill and give me the change outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, sonny,&rdquo; said Dick; &ldquo;but may I
ask the reason of all this mystery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fact is, I&rsquo;ve no smaller change, and I owe
Otto a bit,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Dick sympathetically.</p>
<p>The tenner was duly passed under the table.&nbsp; The young
man lit a cigarette and left the room, passing out into the
&ldquo;roaring Strand.&rdquo;&nbsp; He waited for a quarter of an
hour cooling his heels on the pavement, when he was rejoined by
his friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your change, old chap,&rdquo; said Dick sweetly, as he
handed the youth five shillings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my dear fellow, that was a ten-pun note I gave
you,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; replied Dick.&nbsp; &ldquo;But, you see,
<i>I owed Otto a bit too</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>How
the ingenuous youth explained matters to his father, I have never
heard.</p>
<p>In 1871 I first made the acquaintance of E. J. Odell, the
actor.&nbsp; He then seemed to be a man well advanced in middle
age.&nbsp; He is still alive&mdash;one of the features and
mysteries of the Strand.&nbsp; He is the last of the
Bohemians&mdash;the survival of days (to quote Eccles) &ldquo;as
is gone most like forever.&rdquo;&nbsp; He has contrived to make
a lasting reputation as an actor.&nbsp; His impersonations were
usually in burlesque or opera-bouffe.&nbsp; I can personally
recall two of his Metropolitan engagements.&nbsp; One of these
was in a burlesque at the Gaiety.&nbsp; But he failed there to
justify the high expectations of the management.&nbsp; Even at
rehearsal there were difficulties.&nbsp; Bob Soutar was
stage-manager, and, being a bit of a martinet, he and Odell did
not quite &ldquo;hit it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Odell played on tour as Gaspard the miser in &ldquo;Les
Cloches de Corneville,&rdquo; and I believe acquitted himself
very creditably, which is no small thing to say of any performer
following Shiel Barry in the same part.&nbsp; For Barry&rsquo;s
performance was one of the finest bits of acting seen on the
London stage in my time.&nbsp; On the first night of Shiel
Barry&rsquo;s appearance in the part, I first understood the
meaning of the phrase (Edmund Kean&rsquo;s, is it not?),
&ldquo;The Pit rose at me.&rdquo;&nbsp; When the curtain fell on
the second act of &ldquo;Les Cloches,&rdquo; moved by the
intensity of Shiel Barry&rsquo;s acting in the final scene of the
act, the audience rose to their feet in all parts of the
house.&nbsp; It was an outburst of genuine enthusiasm which
called the performer before the curtain again and again.&nbsp;
Lord Kilmorey&mdash;at that time Lord Newry&mdash;was sitting
next to me in the stalls.&nbsp; He does not strike one as being a
very emotional sort of nobleman; but he was carried away like the
rest of us by a wave of pulsating fervour which was quite
irresistible.</p>
<p>But to return to Odell.&nbsp; If that gentleman has not
achieved a long record of successes <i>on</i> the stage, he has
certainly made a great reputation <i>off</i> it.&nbsp; My friend
Hollingshead was right when he described Odell as a monologue
entertainer.&nbsp; His entertainments, to be successful, must, <a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>however, be
of a private or semi-private nature.&nbsp; Certain of his ballads
are conceived more or less on the lines of Sala&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Bet Belmanor.&rdquo;&nbsp; One of them was a weird thing
commencing:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Oh! was it in the garding,<br />
Or was it in the &rsquo;all?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He had an unctuous manner of rendering this gem which was
quite his own&mdash;a manner unique and of humour all
compact.</p>
<p>There can be little doubt that Odell deliberately adopted the
pose of an eccentric.&nbsp; He enjoyed the surprise and interest
occasioned by his appearance when he promenaded the Strand.&nbsp;
He had a thin, clean-shaven face which would have been ascetic
were it not for a perennial smile.&nbsp; He wore his hair long;
rolling down on his shoulders, it fell in a brown cascade.&nbsp;
Above was a wide black sombrero tilted rakishly on one
side.&nbsp; His coat&mdash;worn summer and winter&mdash;was an
ulster cut very wide in the skirt.&nbsp; He walked with a curious
swaying gait which caused the ulster to undulate its skirts from
side to side.&nbsp; If his object were to attract public
attention to his person, he most undoubtedly succeeded.&nbsp;
Country cousins encountering the strange figure were sure to spot
him as a celebrity of some sort, and inquire as to his
identity.&nbsp; Every gamin, in that thoroughfare of gamins, was
ready with the answer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Im?&nbsp; W&rsquo;y, that&rsquo;s Odell, the
hactor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Odell has a very pretty wit of his own, and there is no member
of the Savage Club&mdash;of which he is one of the oldest
members&mdash;who can hope to get the better of him in
repartee.&nbsp; I remember hearing him sit very severely on a
pompous member of the old Lancaster Club, in the Savoy.&nbsp;
Odell happened to invite one or two of his friends to drink with
him.&nbsp; The rude and pompous person approached the group, and
Odell, on hospitality intent, invited him to have a drink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; replied the would-be wit, &ldquo;I only
drink with gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, sir,&rdquo; flashed out Odell, without a
moment&rsquo;s hesitation, &ldquo;let me assure you that <i>you
will never die of delirium tremens</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>Odell&rsquo;s age has always been as profound a mystery
as his place of residence.&nbsp; Much time and ingenuity have
been expended by his associates in the endeavour to unravel these
mysteries.&nbsp; As the place of his birth has never been
divulged, there is an insuperable difficulty in obtaining
information under the first head; while as to the second, he has
never been known to leave his club until all the other members
have departed.&nbsp; Of all London, Odell holds the record of
&ldquo;latest to bed.&rdquo;&nbsp; The genial Bohemian has in his
old age been very well treated by his clubs&mdash;more
particularly by the Savage.&nbsp; But what the Savage Club would
be without Odell one cannot imagine.&nbsp; The chief of the
Bohemian clubs cannot afford to lose the chief of the
Bohemians.</p>
<p>Your average pressman, with an observing eye and an open mind,
is bound to knock up against a greater number of charlatans than
the member of any other profession.&nbsp; For publicity is to the
charlatan the breath of his nostrils, and the Press is the most
potent engine in procuring publicity of which the charlatan has
any knowledge.&nbsp; And it will be borne in mind that your
properly-constituted charlatan does not at all care what
description of publicity he attains so long as the quantity is
all right.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Better be damned
than mentioned not at all&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>is his motto.&nbsp; Notoriety rather than celebrity is his
aim.</p>
<p>Taking this as the measure of his aims, I conceive that the
Marquis De Leuville was the greatest charlatan that loomed
through all the jocund years.&nbsp; To begin with, he was no more
a Marquis than I am; and, to complete the absurdity of his
pretensions, although he bore a high-sounding French title, he
was not a Frenchman.&nbsp; But he had every possible claim to the
title of &ldquo;odd fish.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was an
Englishman.&nbsp; His name was Oliver, and the place of his
nativity was the city of Bath.&nbsp; Various accounts have been
circulated concerning his early life.&nbsp; Some of these legends
declared him to have been a hairdresser&rsquo;s assistant;
others, that he had commenced as page-boy to a Bath doctor.&nbsp;
About these matters he himself was persistently <a
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>reticent.&nbsp; The literary world first heard of his
existence by means of a novel in three volumes&mdash;at that time
the simple and inexpensive method of publishing a couple of
shilling&rsquo;s worth of fiction.&nbsp; I forget the title of
the book, I never read it; but I discovered some time after its
appearance that, although the title-page described it as
&ldquo;by the Marquis De Leuville,&rdquo; it was the work of one
of those literary &ldquo;ghosts&rdquo; of whose labours, all
through his artistic career, the &ldquo;Marky,&rdquo; as he was
called, liberally availed himself.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Marky&rsquo;s&rdquo; novel was reviewed in the
daily and weekly Press.&nbsp; In many quarters it was even
favourably reviewed.&nbsp; For there are snobs in Fleet Street,
as there are everywhere else, and there were certain
book-reviewers who would consider it bad form to say anything
that was not quite civil about the productions of a Marquis, even
though the title he bore was only a French one.&nbsp; The
appearance, and newspaper acceptance, of the book established
those friendly relations with the Press concerning which our
friend Oliver had been so solicitous.&nbsp; Having once
established his footing in Fleet Street, the &ldquo;Marky&rdquo;
was most assiduous in his attention to those individuals with
whom his work had found favour.&nbsp; By them he was introduced
to others.&nbsp; And so he extended his connection like a good
commercial traveller.&nbsp; It was rather unfortunate for the
adventurer that, at the moment of his advent as a writer, Mr.
Henry Labouchere had just commenced, in <i>Truth</i>, that
crusade against impostors, charlatans, and social parasites
generally, which at once made his paper and protected the
public&mdash;one of those rare occasions by which public
benefactors have made anything out of their labours.&nbsp; In the
most matter-of-fact way Labouchere laid bare the pretensions of
the mock Marquis, and left him without a rag of reputation to his
back.</p>
<p>Little incidents of the kind are always allowed for in the
calculations of an adventurer.&nbsp; The Marquis De Leuville,
following the example of &ldquo;ole Brer Fox&rdquo; in the
allegory, determined to &ldquo;lay low an&rsquo; say
nuffin.&rdquo;&nbsp; When the Labouchere disclosures were
forgotten, the scandal blown <a name="page141"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 141</span>over, and the sportsmen of Carteret
Street busy on the trail of some other quarry, the
Marquis-who-was-not-a-Marquis and author-who-was-not-an-author
made his reappearance.&nbsp; Invitations to garden-parties at the
Priory, Kilburn, issued by a Mrs. Peters, descended like a shower
of snow on newspaper offices.&nbsp; And those who accepted them
were received at the Priory by a very affable, not to say merry,
widow, who had very sensibly discarded the trappings and the
suits of woe.&nbsp; This was Mrs. Peters, the owner of the house
and grounds.&nbsp; And in these pleasant surroundings we found
the Marquis installed.&nbsp; The game was a very pretty
one.&nbsp; Mrs. Peters was the widow of a wealthy
coach-builder.&nbsp; And in the chaste fastnesses of Kilburn she
had thought to establish a <i>salon</i>.&nbsp; Here she would
play the part of Madame R&eacute;camier to the Chateaubriand of a
Bath Oliver!</p>
<p>Quick to read between the lines, the journalists who had been
induced to accept an invitation to the Priory were able now to
piece together the whole story.&nbsp; The giddy relict of the
deceased coach-builder was the founder of the
&ldquo;Marky&rsquo;s&rdquo; fortunes.&nbsp; Her cheque had paid
for the French marquisate.&nbsp; The Marquis De Leuville was,
indeed, a work of fiction conceived, constructed, and given to
the public, by Mrs. Peters.&nbsp; And it was a work of fiction
transcending in human interest anything in the same line which
could be produced by Oliver or his &ldquo;ghosts.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The <i>salon</i> at Kilburn failed to fulfil the hopes of its
promoters; Society&mdash;even society with a little
&ldquo;s&rdquo;&mdash;fought shy of it.&nbsp; It was felt that
Mrs. Peters as Madame R&eacute;camier and her
prot&eacute;g&eacute; as Chateaubriand did less than justice to
their several parts.</p>
<p>A suite of rooms was then taken for the Marquis in Victoria
Street, Westminster, somewhere opposite the Army and Navy
Stores.&nbsp; Here the indomitable humbug gave receptions,
issuing the invitations in his own name.&nbsp; At these
receptions one met the most weird characters&mdash;the shy
denizens of the fringe of Bohemia, ostracized clerics, unread
authors, swashbucklers of doubtful nationality, but about whose
character there could be no sort of doubt whatever.</p>
<p><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>Mr.
Harry De Windt, in his interesting book of reminiscence, gives an
anecdote concerning the Marquis and his Victoria Street
receptions, which, if worth telling at all, was worth telling
correctly.&nbsp; I now relate the incident as it was repeated to
me by Mr. Charles Collette, the well-known actor.&nbsp; At one of
these assemblies in Victoria Street the Marquis invited two or
three of the guests to remain and &ldquo;have a bite&rdquo; with
him.&nbsp; When the general body of the guests had retired, these
selected individuals were taken to the dining-room, where the
merry widow was discovered awaiting them.&nbsp; Half a dozen
people sat down to a meal which consisted chiefly of potatoes and
mutton cutlets.&nbsp; Collette sat on the left of the Marquis,
who took the head of the table.&nbsp; The Marquis was not a
pretty eater, and that&rsquo;s the truth.&nbsp; He detached a
whole cutlet from the bone, and put it into his mouth as one
bite.&nbsp; Looking up, he saw the amazed expression on
Collette&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a devil of a twist,&rdquo; explained the
Marquis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see.&nbsp; An Oliver twist,&rdquo; said Collette
sweetly.</p>
<p>De Leuville called on me once in Fleet Street while I was
editing a weekly paper.&nbsp; One of my contributors had fallen
foul of a poem bearing the nobleman&rsquo;s name.&nbsp; The
reviewer had discovered in the verses every fault which the
author of a poetical composition could by any possibility
commit.&nbsp; De Leuville&rsquo;s principal object in seeking an
interview was, he declared, to prove to me that
&ldquo;shore&rdquo; was a true rhyme to
&ldquo;Samoa.&rdquo;&nbsp; He did not quite succeed.&nbsp; He was
a man with a big, round, foolish face; he wore a moustache and
imperial.&nbsp; He had very broad shoulders, and wore his collar
so low as to give him something of a
<i>d&eacute;collet&eacute;</i> appearance.&nbsp; His black tie
was big and flamboyant, and suggested the boulevards&mdash;as it
was, no doubt, intended to do.&nbsp; His hair was long, and his
broad-brimmed silk hat was worn slightly tilted to one side,
indicating that he was rather a dog of a Marquis.&nbsp; He wore
stays, which had the effect of adding, apparently, to the width
of his shoulders.&nbsp; On his fingers were large rings of
eccentric design.&nbsp; And the man literally stank&mdash;there
is no other word for it&mdash;of unguents and essences.&nbsp;
That was the first occasion on which I had the doubtful <a
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>pleasure of
seeing the Marquis De Leuville.&nbsp; The last time I encountered
him was about three years since at Boulogne.&nbsp; He was a
greatly altered marquis.&nbsp; His long grey hair fell over his
shoulders; he wore a black soft felt hat, a black velvet
dinner-jacket.&nbsp; He looked a rather seedy and shrivelled
Marquis.&nbsp; Altogether he had the appearance of a stunted
Buffalo Bill fallen upon evil days.&nbsp; He was accompanied in
his visits to the <i>&eacute;tablissement</i> by a group of
octogenarian lady admirers.&nbsp; He lived in an hotel at one
side of the estuary; they lived in a hotel on the other.&nbsp;
Everything was entirely respectable and platonic.&nbsp; And it
was quite pathetic, I thought, to hear the shrill voice of the
merry widow&mdash;for the &ldquo;Marky,&rdquo; like the Pope, was
still supported by &ldquo;Peters&rsquo;
Pence&rdquo;&mdash;rebuking a friend, and announcing
emphatically:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, the Marquis has a soul above
gambling!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Messengers came and went between the hotels, and a pleasant
interchange of amenities was constantly taking place.&nbsp; The
Marquis, from his retreat near the railway-station, despatched
little presents of scent and trifling sonnets to his
mistress&rsquo;s eyebrow.&nbsp; These manuscripts the recipient
read in her high piping voice to her satellites, describing them
as &ldquo;p&rsquo;tee morr-sow.&rdquo;&nbsp; And I suppose in
exchange for the bottles of strange smells and the poems there
was a generous supply of &ldquo;Peters&rsquo; pence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During his stay in Boulogne the Marquis invented a new
boot-varnish, the secret of applying which belonged to himself
alone.&nbsp; He spent quite an hour a day varnishing his boots,
the result being that he was evicted, one after another, from
half the hotels in the town.&nbsp; His varnish had a nasty habit
of communicating itself to table-linen, carpets, or any other
hotel property that happened to touch it.&nbsp; But Oliver stuck
to his boot-varnish, and permitted himself to be driven from
hostelry to hostelry rather than abandon it.&nbsp; He afforded a
fine example of the old nobility sacrificing itself on the altar
of principle.&nbsp; A year after I had seen him in Boulogne I
read of his death; and the devoted chatelaine of the Priory,
Kilburn, soon followed him into a realm where charlatanism is, we
may imagine, at a discount.</p>
<p><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>Colonel Whitehead was another gentleman who thought it
well to establish relations with gentlemen on the Press&mdash;on
the principle, I suppose, that it is well to make friends of the
mammon of unrighteousness.&nbsp; The Colonel was a great admirer
of the stage, more particularly that department of the stage
which devotes itself to the encouragement of histrionic talent in
good-looking young women.&nbsp; He was a haunter of stage-doors,
was admitted, here and there, to the <i>coulisses</i>, and was
one of those patrons of the drama whose patronage takes a
practical turn in the case of its female professors.&nbsp; In
order to indulge his tastes in this direction, he leased the
Canterbury for a season, revived the ballet with some of its
ancient glory, and thoroughly enjoyed himself among the members
of the corps.&nbsp; But the experiment was a costly one, and his
operations were subsequently carried on at a less ruinous scale
of expenditure.</p>
<p>He was one of the original members of Russell&rsquo;s Club for
Ladies.&nbsp; Here he would turn up of a night with the largest
shirt-front in London, in the middle of which sparkled a diamond
of prodigious size.&nbsp; The Colonel was sitting one night in
the drawing-room of the club, waiting, no doubt, for one of those
ladies for whose special convenience Russell had founded his
club.&nbsp; A boyish officer in one of the regiments of Guards
was sitting not far off staring at the Colonel, whose get-up
fascinated him.&nbsp; The youthful Guardsman was not nearly as
sober as he might have been.&nbsp; Having gazed, fascinated, for
a length of time at the Colonel, he called out:
&ldquo;Waiter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yessir,&rdquo; said the servant who answered the
summons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;er&mdash;waiter, who&rsquo;s (hic) that man
with the lighthouse in his stomach?&rdquo;</p>
<p>From that day to the day of his death Whitehead was known as
Colonel Lighthouse.&nbsp; The Colonel had a big house outside
Margate, to which at week-ends he invited his theatrical and
literary friends.&nbsp; And the highest sort of high-jinks were
carried on there.</p>
<p>A certain Irish nobleman was on his death-bed.&nbsp; The
priest came to him.&nbsp; The holy man was anxious to get a <a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>general
confession from him.&nbsp; The nobleman declared he had nothing
to confess.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look back on your past life, my
lord.&nbsp; Is there nothing you regret?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;<i>I never denied
myself a pleasure</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He closed his eyes, fell back on his pillow, and, in that
happy belief, died.</p>
<p>Whitehead was a gentleman of that kidney, and brings to an end
my selections from an almost inexhaustible list of odd fish.</p>

146</span>CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="GutSmall">BOHEMIAN CLUBS</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> promotion of clubs became a
very busy industry under the consulate of Plancus.&nbsp; Of these
promotions but few survive, and of these few none are of the
proprietary kind.&nbsp; A club, to survive, must have arisen in
response to an actual need, and out of the regular assembling of
those who are kindred spirits, or who are brought together by
common professional interests.&nbsp; The promoters of proprietary
clubs are forced to provide for their enterprises both a demand
and a supply.&nbsp; Were the gambling laws less drastic in this
country, I can easily conceive that a fortune might be made by
the proprietor of a roulette and baccarat club.&nbsp; But the
promotion of ordinary social rialtos involves a considerable
amount of risk.&nbsp; I must have belonged to a dozen of these
mushroom institutions between 1870 and 1890, and I was on the
committee of a fourth of them.&nbsp; But whether we started with
palatial premises or with an unpretentious flat, the end came
soon or late.&nbsp; Members seemed always to have an insuperable
diffidence about paying their subscriptions, and proprietors had
an equally insuperable objection to expelling defaulters.</p>
<p>For some years a gentleman named Russell displayed great
pertinacity in pursuing this particular line of promotion.&nbsp;
Mr. Russell was, I believe, the son of Henry Russell, the
well-known ballad-singer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Cheer, Boys, Cheer&rdquo;
Russell the old man was called.&nbsp; By his rendering of that
song and other spirited compositions by Dr. Charles Mackay, he
had added immensely to his reputation, and greatly assisted that
tide of emigration that was then setting to the West.&nbsp; His
son evidently did not believe in the depopulation of his native
<a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
147</span>land.&nbsp; He was keen on the construction of places
of comfortable resort which would induce people to remain right
here.</p>
<p>Russell&rsquo;s first promotion might have proved a success
had it been properly financed and discreetly managed.&nbsp; It
was founded at what was, or should have been, the psychological
moment.&nbsp; It had really fine premises, splendid rooms, and an
excellent service.&nbsp; It was situated at the corner of a
street running off the Strand, over against St.
Mary-le-Strand.&nbsp; It had a strong committee of well-known
barristers and literary men, and it was, very happily, called the
Temple Club.&nbsp; But in his desire to swell the roll of
members, Russell encouraged laxity in the labours of the
committee.&nbsp; Men were elected who would have been blackballed
at any West End club, and men dropped in at night who were not
members at all.&nbsp; The latter circumstance was brought to my
notice in a very unpleasant way.</p>
<p>I had been at a performance at the Strand Theatre, and in the
foyer I had met Mr. Vincent Boyes, a gentleman well known in
literary and artistic circles.&nbsp; Boyes was a most highly
respectable person, the very pink of propriety, and an inordinate
stickler for <i>les convenances</i>.&nbsp; He was, moreover, a
man old enough to have been my father.&nbsp; I invited Boyes to
turn into the Temple Club for half an hour.&nbsp; He
accepted.&nbsp; We entered the club, I called for some
refreshment, and after it had been served we were joined by a man
who was personally known to both of us.&nbsp; The new-comer was a
soldier of fortune, a bit of a swashbuckler, a traveller, and a
most amusing raconteur.&nbsp; It is unnecessary to mention his
name in this connection.&nbsp; He kept us in fits of laughter for
an hour, during which time both he and I had replenished the
glass of the almost oppressively respectable Boyes.&nbsp; At the
conclusion of one of the swashbuckler&rsquo;s narratives, Boyes
said gravely: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I can&rsquo;t ask you
fellows to have a drink with me, but I&rsquo;m not a
member.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Order away, old chap&mdash;no more am
I!&rdquo; exclaimed the cheery raconteur.&nbsp; Boyes regarded
the man with a look of horror.&nbsp; He rose from his seat, took
leave of me, and stalked out of the place without flinging even a
nod to the soldier of fortune.&nbsp; That a man should have
played the host to <a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>him in a club of which that host was not a member was
to Boyes the unforgivable offence.</p>
<p>In that same smoking-room there used frequently to meet a
little coterie of journalists, among whom were Tom Dunning, one
of the most respected men in &ldquo;the Gallery&rdquo;; H. H. S.
Pearse, special correspondent of the <i>Daily News</i>; and
Charles Williams, war-correspondent of many dailies in
succession: for Charles, although an accomplished journalist, had
an Irish temper, and frequently &ldquo;quarrelled with his bread
and butter.&rdquo;&nbsp; I have met many eminent romancers in my
time.&nbsp; Charlie Williams could have given Baron Munchausen a
stone and a beating.&nbsp; He spoke with a rasping North of
Ireland accent, and his campaign anecdotes gained greatly by the
stolid, matter-of-fact manner in which they were narrated.&nbsp;
I recall now one of his campaign reminiscences.&nbsp; It is a
quaint experience of a correspondent under fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had got under cover of a big boulder, and had
tethered my horse beside me.&nbsp; I was just munchin&rsquo; a
beskit, when a shall burst on the rock, an&rsquo; shot the
nosebag right off my charger.&nbsp; He had shoved his daumned
ould head out of cover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you?&rdquo; asked Pearse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just went on munchin&rsquo; my beskit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; suggested Dunning, &ldquo;if the shell took
away the nosebag, it ought to have carried away the beast&rsquo;s
head as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>It did</i>!&rdquo; replied Williams, with the utmost
sang-froid.</p>
<p>In the same place, but on another occasion, I heard him aver
with the utmost solemnity that he had been selected by the
Liberal party to oppose Sir Hugh M&rsquo;Calmont Cairns, when
that eminent man&mdash;afterwards Earl Cairns&mdash;first stood
for Belfast in the Conservative interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ef,&rdquo; declared Charlie, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d stud
against Sir Hugh when first he put up for Bel-fawst,
there&rsquo;d be no such a personage now as Lord Cairns, Lord
High Chawncellor of England!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was a bit of a romancer, was Williams.&nbsp; It should be
admitted, however, that Williams did, at a later period in his
career, stand as a candidate for Imperial Parliament.&nbsp; He
opposed Herbert Gladstone at Leeds.</p>
<p><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>Another promotion of Russell&rsquo;s was his club for
ladies.&nbsp; As a sort of major-domo for this establishment,
Russell engaged the services of the obese but obliging
&ldquo;Fatty&rdquo; Coleman, who had some time previously left
the mild pursuits of a private life for the bustle of a public
one.&nbsp; He was assistant-manager of the Aquarium when Russell
captured him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fatty&rdquo; was a broad and beaming
man, of immense geniality, and in every sense a most expansive
person.&nbsp; As the presiding genius of a club for ladies he was
entirely in his element.&nbsp; But the time for what were
irreverently called &ldquo;cock-and-hen&rdquo; clubs had not
fully come, and this venture of the indefatigable promoter went
the road to dusty death which had been taken by the unfortunate
gentleman&rsquo;s other efforts to divert and refine human
society.&nbsp; The adventures of the ingenuous
&ldquo;Fatty&rdquo; would make a volume of their own.&nbsp; I
last encountered him in a French watering-place, where he was
acting as a sort of manager&rsquo;s representative to an hotel
much frequented by Englishmen.&nbsp; He had lost some of his
flesh, but none of his beaming bonhomie.&nbsp; There was a
legend&mdash;I have never tested its authenticity&mdash;that
&ldquo;Fatty&rdquo; had at one time held a commission in a
regiment of the Guards.</p>
<p>While the social activities of Russell were at their busiest,
the field was entered by another club-promoter.&nbsp; He,
however, after a short experience became weary of
well-doing.&nbsp; This was the Hon. John Colborne.&nbsp; The Hon.
John&mdash;&ldquo;Dirty Jack&rdquo; was his sobriquet in his
regiment&mdash;had become known to the public as the defendant in
a criminal libel suit brought against him by a moneylender.&nbsp;
John had got deep into the books of the remorseless Israelite,
and, seeing no way of settling with him in coin, determined to
pay him in kind; so he sat down and wrote an extremely diverting
and trenchant little book entitled &ldquo;The Vampires of
London.&rdquo;&nbsp; Herein the methods of usury were exposed in
a fierce light.&nbsp; This, however, the wily Jew might have
forgiven.&nbsp; What he could never forgive was the ridicule
which the gallant officer threw on his
<i>m&eacute;nage</i>.&nbsp; He had invited his customer to accept
the hospitality of his home, and now the secrets of that home
were held up to public ridicule and contempt.&nbsp; The writer <a
name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>had not
spared the members of the family.&nbsp; The very children of
Israel were sacrificed on the altar of John&rsquo;s
vengeance.&nbsp; The allurements of Rachael, the schemes of
&ldquo;blear-eyed Leah,&rdquo; were set forth with fiendish
particularity.</p>
<p>The trial came off at the Old Bailey, and the prosecutor was
represented by a rising barrister called Mr. Hardinge
Giffard.&nbsp; That rising young barrister has, in so far as the
Bar is concerned, risen and set many a day ago.&nbsp; He is now
Lord Halsbury.&nbsp; The jury found for the persecuted
Hebrew.&nbsp; The Hon. John was sentenced to certain months in
gaol as a first-class misdemeanant, and ordered to pay a heavy
fine.&nbsp; Defendants in cases of the kind were not so closely
watched in those days as they are in the present year of grace,
and when Mr. Colborne was called upon to receive sentence he was
nowhere to be found.&nbsp; Having a very clear notion of the sort
of verdict the jury would give, he had skipped over to France
earlier in the day.</p>
<p>John had carried with him across the Channel a new and
enlarged edition of &ldquo;The Vampires,&rdquo; and he at once
set about issuing copies by post to advertisers desiring to
acquire a work about which the trial had set all the town
talking.&nbsp; To stop this fresh persecution, plaintiff was
willing to accept any sort of terms in reason.&nbsp; All that Mr.
Colborne desired was liberty to return to his native land, to
obtain cancellation of the excessive interest on his bills, and
to live thenceforth in peace with all men.&nbsp; His friends were
enabled to arrange terms on this basis, and John was free to
prosecute those schemes for improving the condition of his
fellow-man to which he purposed to devote his energies.&nbsp; His
schemes were fated to &ldquo;gang agley.&rdquo;&nbsp; He joined
the Egyptian army, and died in action.&nbsp; It was probably the
kind of death he would have wished, for, however he may have
proved wanting in other qualities, no one ever doubted his high
courage.</p>
<p>Chinery, in his club promotions, aimed at higher game.&nbsp;
He had served as Consul-General in a West African State, was a
member of the Reform and the Devonshire, was a convinced Liberal,
and had a wonderfully good connection.&nbsp; Owing to these
circumstances, he was able to muster a much <a
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>stronger
committee than others who had started before him in the club
industry.&nbsp; His first venture was the Empire Club.&nbsp; For
this establishment he had acquired what the auctioneers call
&ldquo;eligible&rdquo; premises.&nbsp; He got a lease of the
house in Grafton Street, Piccadilly, which had been the last home
of Lord Brougham.&nbsp; Men like the late (and great) Marquis of
Dufferin became members.&nbsp; Viscount Bury was President of the
club.&nbsp; A large membership, including many leading colonials,
was assured.&nbsp; The management was reliable, the cellar
unimpeachable, the house dinner (always presided over by a
colonial Governor-General or some other potentate interested in
our overseas Empire) became a welcome feature, and a long spell
of prosperity seemed to be ahead of us.&nbsp; But our hopes did
not reach fruition.&nbsp; Something went wrong with the accounts,
and the Empire closed its doors.</p>
<p>The festive Chinery, in no whit discouraged, started on fresh
promotions.&nbsp; None of them achieved the brilliant reputation
of his original venture, and Chinery himself died a broken
man.</p>
<p>At one time I belonged to a club called the Wanderers, in
compliment, I suppose, to the Travellers, which was nearly
opposite.&nbsp; The club-house occupied the corner, on the other
side of Pall Mall, corresponding to that of the
Athen&aelig;um.&nbsp; This was a comfortable and well-found
establishment.&nbsp; Tod Heatley, the wine-merchant, was supposed
to be interested in it; but it passed through many vicissitudes,
and went under many names, till it was eventually devoted to more
profitable purposes.&nbsp; Although the Wanderers had always
other and higher pretensions, it was essentially a Bohemian
club.&nbsp; A mixture of such pretensions with such actualities
should be foredoomed to failure.&nbsp; In clubland the Wanderers
was known as &ldquo;The Home for Lost Dogs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chief among the genuine Bohemian clubs is the Savage Club,
whose home is on the Adelphi Terrace.&nbsp; Although the
Bohemianism of this famous club is mainly traditional, it
preserves the good custom of general communication among members,
and encourages that spirit of playful geniality which is
inseparable from the idea of Bohemianism.&nbsp; But the Savage
Club of to-day is a very different thing from the <a
name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>same
association as I knew it in 1870.&nbsp; This, indeed, will be
admitted by the official historian of the club, Mr. Aaron Watson,
whose admirable monograph on the Savage leaves nothing for any
future writer to tell concerning the genesis and early struggles
of the Savages.</p>
<p>I was a guest at the Savage on about half a dozen occasions in
early years, and I once passed a few hours with Christie Murray
in its new and more abiding home.</p>
<p>It was on a dull November day, and Pat Macdonald and I were
walking westward from Fleet Street.&nbsp; We had taken Covent
Garden on our way.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see if there&rsquo;s
anybody in the Savage Club,&rdquo; he said casually, as we left
the central avenue of the market, under the shadow of St.
Paul&rsquo;s, of the convent garden.&nbsp; To me the invitation
was delightful.&nbsp; Often I had heard of the celebrated resort
of actors, authors, and musicians.&nbsp; With the rest of the
world, I had become impressed with the idea that election to this
coterie was extremely difficult.&nbsp; I had read with much
interest the first issue of &ldquo;The Savage Club Papers,&rdquo;
and it came upon me as a surprise that my friend Macdonald, whose
contributions to literature were of the most tenuous character,
should be a member, and that he should hold his membership so
lightly.</p>
<p>Soon I discovered the reason, and this, by the way, is a
rather interesting morsel of history which has escaped the
vigilant eye of Mr. Aaron Watson.&nbsp; In those early and
unsophisticated days, when a man was put up for membership at the
Savage, he was given the run of the club until the date of the
next election; and some men are by nature such excellent company
that a club existing above all other things for congenial
companionship will be apt to regard the claims of the
professionally unqualified candidate as above those of the highly
qualified man who happens to be a dull dog.&nbsp; This month of
probation afforded the good fellow&mdash;&ldquo;the clubbable
man&rdquo; of Dr. Johnson&mdash;the opportunity of asserting his
claims; and although the committee was bound by its first rule,
which provided that only men professionally connected with
literature, the drama, or the arts, should be eligible, when they
got the chance of electing a man of Macdonald&rsquo;s erudition,
humour, and powers of conversation, <a name="page153"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 153</span>they were not likely to give that
chance away.&nbsp; It was a strange rule, but it worked
well.&nbsp; In those days there was no place in a club forced to
forgather in a single room for men who could not talk well and
laugh loudly.</p>
<p>Under the guidance of my friend, I crossed to the right
through the inevitable slush and vegetable refuse, and we were
soon mounting the steps that led to Evans&rsquo;s Hotel.&nbsp;
With the celebrated Supper-Room beneath the hotel I was already
acquainted, but I had never before visited the hotel.&nbsp; Nor
did I for a moment imagine that the club which occupied so large
a place in my fancy and my esteem occupied rooms on licensed
premises.&nbsp; The Savage Club was in possession of the room on
the left of the hall as you entered the hotel.&nbsp; It had
originally been the coffee-room, and was one of the principal
apartments in the building.&nbsp; Evans&rsquo;s Hotel is now the
National Sporting Club.&nbsp; It was first the Falstaff, and to
fit it for its new purposes considerable structural alterations
were necessary, including a small private theatre, now abolished,
but the lines of the old home of the Savages can still be made
out.</p>
<p>There were very few members present on the occasion of this
first visit of mine, and I was reminded of the omnipresence of
the legal profession on finding that two of them were
barristers.&nbsp; One was Mr. Jonas Levy, Chairman of the London,
Brighton, and South Coast Railway; and the other Mr. Hume
Williams&mdash;not the K.C. and Recorder of Norwich, but the
father of that learned gentleman.&nbsp; Another of those present
was Henry S. Leigh, the author of &ldquo;The Carols of
Cockayne&rdquo;&mdash;a gentleman whom I came to know
intimately.&nbsp; He had the bitterest tongue and sweetest nature
of any man I ever met.&nbsp; The arrangements of the room
testified to the simplicity of taste observed by those primitive
Savages.&nbsp; On the tables that lined the walls were laid out
clay pipes of the shape and size with which we associate the name
&ldquo;churchwarden,&rdquo; and I observed that Leigh was
drinking beer out of a pewter pot.&nbsp; There are no pewter pots
in the Savage Club nowadays, but neither are there any
Leighs.</p>
<p>Whether it was the deadly dulness of the autumn afternoon or
my own lack of responsiveness, or whether it was <a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>that I had
cherished exaggerated expectations, or whether it was the result
of a conspiracy of all these causes, I cannot say, but my first
visit to the Savage was a disappointment and a disillusion.&nbsp;
A year or more went by before I was afforded an opportunity of
reviewing my earlier impressions.&nbsp; This time I had no cause
to complain of the quality of the entertainment.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Jimmy&rdquo; Albery, who had recently made his name with
&ldquo;Two Roses&rdquo;; H. S. Leigh; E. A. Sothern; George
Honey, the actor; Arthur Boyd Houghton, the artist; and Andrew
Halliday, the author and journalist-dramatist, were among those
present.&nbsp; My earlier impressions were at once erased.&nbsp;
Never had I been thrown into the society of a number of grown men
where such a spirit of fun, of <i>camaraderie</i>, of
irresponsibility, and of the joy of life, prevailed and
sparkled.&nbsp; They talked in the spirit of schoolboys, but with
the point of seasoned wits.&nbsp; It was altogether a delightful
experience.</p>
<p>It was at the Savage Club that I first saw the game of poker
played.&nbsp; The game had been introduced by some Americans who
enjoyed the privileges of corresponding membership in respect of
their connection with the Lotus Club, New York.&nbsp; It was
shortly made taboo by a ukase of the Portland and Turf Clubs, and
disappeared from the card-rooms of all the West End clubs.&nbsp;
I have always thought this rather a pity.&nbsp; Poker is one of
the best games to be got out of a pack.&nbsp; It calls into
exercise other faculties beside memory, judgment, skill, and a
nice knowledge of the value of cards.&nbsp; You want to be a bit
of a physiognomist.&nbsp; Your own expression should be under
control, and your manner absolutely inscrutable.&nbsp; It is in
respect of their natural endowment in these qualities that the
Yankees make such good poker-players.&nbsp; I became greatly
interested in the game, and it was indirectly through my
instrumentality that its rules were first published in this
country.&nbsp; General Schenk drew up the enactments governing
the science of the pastime, at the request of Lady
Waldegrave.&nbsp; Lady Waldegrave had them set up in type at
Strawberry Hill.&nbsp; She had a few dozen copies printed for the
use of her acquaintances.&nbsp; I became the proud possessor of
one of these copies.&nbsp; A friend <a name="page155"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 155</span>of mine&mdash;or perhaps I should
say a gentleman whom up to that time I had regarded as a
friend&mdash;induced me to lend him the brochure to settle some
dispute which had arisen between certain correspondents on his
paper; for my friend was a rather distinguished writer on the
sporting press.&nbsp; I never saw that book again, but to my
intense surprise and chagrin I found the whole of the Strawberry
Hill rules published in the columns of my friend&rsquo;s paper,
with their place of origin given, and Lady Waldegrave&rsquo;s
authority cited.</p>
<p>The transaction did more harm to the gentleman who had
betrayed my confidence than it did to me.&nbsp; In those days an
act of the kind would be generally reprobated.&nbsp; Dog did not
eat dog when Plancus was Consul.&nbsp; Nowadays I am given to
understand that it would be regarded as a bit of smart
journalism.</p>
<p>As I write, the memory of that first game of draw-poker comes
vividly back to me, and, singular as it may seem to you, it comes
back to an accompaniment of music.&nbsp; It was night, and in the
supper-room below and at the back the little pale-faced
choristers in their Eton suits were singing glees for Paddy
Green&rsquo;s customers.&nbsp; These vocal exercises were
resented by grumpy members of the club, but to me distance
enhanced the beauty of the singing, and I never hear poker
mentioned now, such is the strange influence of the association
of ideas, that I do not instantly hear the far-away voices of
boys singing:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Oh, who will o&rsquo;er the downs with
me&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, who will with me ride?<br />
Oh, who will up and follow me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To win a blooming bride?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Poor words, perhaps; set to old-fashioned glee music, no
doubt; introducing in the last line a word rendered vulgar by a
merciless modernity, admitted.&nbsp; But, Lord! how sweet the
memory of them comes back to me over the years&mdash;how
inexpressibly sweet, yet how incalculably sad! for nothing but
the haunting memory is left.&nbsp; My contemporaries of that time
have, nearly all of them, satisfied their curiosity concerning
the Great Secret.&nbsp; The pale-faced choir <a
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>boys have
grown to manhood, developing, perhaps, into &ldquo;fat and greasy
citizens.&rdquo;&nbsp; Only the song remains.</p>
<p>Baker Green, editor of the <i>Morning Post</i>, was a member
of the Savage at a somewhat later date.&nbsp; He was a great
hulking figure of a man, with a terrible mordant humour of his
own, and a devilish solemn manner of stating the most absurd
propositions.&nbsp; His monocle was as inseparable from him as
that of Sir Squire Bancroft.&nbsp; His peculiar style of humour
may be best illustrated anecdotically.</p>
<p>A member who loomed large in the life of the club in the days
when the Imperial Institute was being nursed into life was Somers
Vine.&nbsp; In respect of his services rendered to the Institute
the excellent man received the honour of knighthood.&nbsp; It is
to be feared that Baker Green had no great liking for Sir
Somers.&nbsp; Of this sentiment on the part of his fellow-member,
Vine, it must be supposed, had no inkling, for one evening,
bubbling over with hospitality and brotherly kindness, he
approached Baker Green in the club.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish, my dear fellow, you would come down and spend a
week at my place at Chislehurst,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Delighted,&rdquo; replied the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I live at Vine Court,&rdquo; explained the knight.</p>
<p>Baker Green took out his pocket-book as if to make a note.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What Court did you say?&rdquo; he asked innocently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vine Court,&rdquo; replied the pleased Sir Somers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;er&mdash;<i>and what number</i>?&rdquo;
inquired the remorseless Green.</p>
<p>It is perhaps needless to add that the proposed visit was
never paid.</p>
<p>Sir W. S. Gilbert was an occasional visitor at the
supper-rooms beneath the club.&nbsp; The incident I am about to
relate is scarcely relevant to the subject with which the present
chapter deals, but as it happened on the premises, so to speak, I
may be pardoned for introducing it.&nbsp; At Evans&rsquo;s it was
the custom to pay for your supper to a waiter who stood at the
door&mdash;a lightning calculator who, by the means of a
legerdemain which was all his own, was able to add about 25 per
cent. to every bill without the victim being <a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>able to see
exactly how it was done.&nbsp; Gilbert rather resented the
arithmetical methods of &ldquo;John,&rdquo; and at last came to
the determination to pay &ldquo;John&rdquo; off by tipping him a
penny instead of the sixpence which had hitherto been his
<i>pourboire</i>.&nbsp; On the night on which his resolution was
to be carried into effect his bill amounted to exactly hall a
crown.&nbsp; He handed that coin to the magic calculator, and
then handed his tip of one penny.&nbsp; &ldquo;John&rdquo; looked
at the coin, smiled a deprecating smile, and, handing it back to
the donor, said in a tone of subdued solicitude: &ldquo;Perhaps
you may be going over a bridge, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a toll levied on those crossing Waterloo Bridge in
those days.&nbsp; The retort hit in two ways.&nbsp; The first
suggestion was that the gentleman lived at the other side of the
water; and the second, that he had been reduced to his last
copper.&nbsp; The comment was, in fact, quite Gilbertian&mdash;as
&ldquo;John&rdquo; himself was perfectly well aware.</p>
<p>The doyen of the club was W. B. Tegetmier.&nbsp; He seemed a
survival almost of another age.&nbsp; For he was the same W. B.
Tegetmier to whom Darwin, in his &ldquo;Descent of Man,&rdquo;
makes so many acknowledgments of assistance in connection with
experiments in the breeding of pigeons.&nbsp; He was one of the
first men to use the bicycle as a means of getting to and from
his office at the <i>Field</i>, which was then in the
Strand.&nbsp; He must have been well over sixty at the time, and
he continued to use the machine till he was well over
seventy.&nbsp; A wonderful, wiry, active, peppery-tempered little
man with a kindly expression indicating a heart more kindly
still.&nbsp; Not that he could not say a hard thing when he
thought it absolutely necessary.&nbsp; By his intimates he was
always called &ldquo;Teg.&rdquo;&nbsp; But should any man who was
not an intimate presume thus to address him, he would quickly
resent the familiarity.&nbsp; Thus, on one occasion Mr. Bowles, a
barrister and brother-Savage, finding the little naturalist
there, addressed him by his sobriquet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hallo, how are you, Teg?&rdquo; said the devoted man,
bent on geniality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite well, thank you&mdash;Po!&rdquo; answered the
other icily.</p>
<p>I had the honour of attending two of the Saturday dinners <a
name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>of the
Savage Club.&nbsp; There was nothing quite like those dinners
then; there has been nothing quite like them since.&nbsp; No
after-dinner speeches were permitted, but when the meal&mdash;a
very simple one&mdash;was at an end, the members set about
entertaining their guests and themselves by song, anecdote,
recitation, imitation, and playing upon instruments&mdash;for
some of the finest instrumentalists in England were
Savages.&nbsp; Old George Grossmith&mdash;father of George
Grossmith, the well-known illustrator of Gilbert and Sullivan
opera and platform entertainer, and grandfather of George
Grossmith junior of the Gaiety Theatre&mdash;gave us a reading
from the first chapter of &ldquo;Bleak House&rdquo;; Signor Foli
sang &ldquo;Simon the Cellarer&rdquo;; Oscar Barrett and John
Radcliffe fluted to us; Hamilton Clarke presided at the piano;
Charles Collette pattered; George Honey gave some side-splitting
stories, ably seconded in this department by dear old
&ldquo;Lal&rdquo; Brough.&nbsp; The whole thing went with a
&ldquo;zip.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was no hesitation on the part of
performers; the neophyte who &ldquo;broke down&rdquo; in his
performance was as heartily cheered as the veteran who rendered a
passage reserved for such a gathering.&nbsp; Indeed, the feeling
that one was listening to an entertainment which the public could
not have for love or money added not a little, I imagine, to the
sense of pleasure in those who took part in the post-prandial
entertainment.</p>
<p>The Arundel and the Wigwam were conducted much on Savage
lines, and the Junior Garrick, to which I have made reference in
an earlier chapter, was decidedly a Bohemian institution.&nbsp;
It had two periods.&nbsp; It originally existed as a
members&rsquo; club; but a large number of influential members
quarrelled with the committee and withdrew.&nbsp; The financial
position of those who remained was not sufficiently strong to
justify them in continuing it.&nbsp; And it seemed a pity to
close the doors; for the club occupied a fine house at the corner
of Adam Street and Adelphi Terrace.&nbsp; It remains an excellent
example of Adam architecture, and contains some magnificent Adam
ceilings and cornices.&nbsp; The drawing-room on the first-floor,
with its unrivalled view of the Thames, is a spacious and
well-proportioned apartment.&nbsp; <a name="page159"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 159</span>The room beneath it was our
dining-room, and the billiard-room was at the top of the
house.</p>
<p>Now, whereas the Savage never suffered from any schism, the
Junior Garrick was the victim of no less than two.&nbsp; The
first while it was a members&rsquo; club; the second, when it had
become a proprietary club.&nbsp; The first offshoot organized
itself into the Green-Room Club, which flourishes to this day,
and is at present housed in Leicester Square, nearly facing the
Alhambra.&nbsp; This is now the principal club, entirely composed
of stage professionals.&nbsp; The second offshoot of the old
&ldquo;J.G.C.,&rdquo; as we liked to call it, was the
Yorick.&nbsp; I know the Yorick still exists, for I recently saw
in the daily Press a letter dated from that address.</p>
<p>In these days the Bohemian thinks it no longer good form to
roam around the town attired in the negligent seediness of the
impecunious student of the Quartier Latin.&nbsp; Unkempt locks,
extreme squalor, and dirty finger-nails, are no longer regarded
as essential characteristics of the social Bohemian.&nbsp; In the
process of evolution we have now arrived at the evening-dress
Bohemian.&nbsp; The Eccentric Club at Piccadilly Circus is his
chosen resort.&nbsp; The phenomenal success of this club is
attributable to the fact that the principal members of the
original committee were business men; that it has been enabled to
develop on a very small capital&mdash;some &pound;700, I think;
and that it was so fortunate as to acquire the premises,
furniture, and fixtures, of an expiring institution at a
ridiculously small figure.</p>
<p>This flourishing society grew out of the ashes of the old
Coventry, a proprietary club which existed for some years in
Coventry Street.&nbsp; When that rather cosy resort went the way
of all proprietary clubs, a few of us met at Rule&rsquo;s, in
Maiden Lane, with a view of seeing whether a sufficient number of
old Coventry members could not be induced to found another social
centre in which men who had for some years come to regard the
Coventry as their ordinary place of meeting.&nbsp; The idea
caught on.&nbsp; The title &ldquo;Eccentric&rdquo; was decided on
at our very first meeting.&nbsp; The old premises of the Pelican
were to be had on reasonable terms.&nbsp; And we commenced, with
a good list of members, in those sacred <a
name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>precincts.&nbsp; Among the actors who joined were
&ldquo;Lal&rdquo; Brough and Arthur Roberts, and among the
artists were Phil May, Julian Price, and Paleologue.&nbsp; The
last-named gentleman adorned the walls of the club-house with
some very spirited mural decorations.&nbsp; So spirited, indeed,
was the fresco from the atelier of Paleologue, that when the club
gave what were called &ldquo;ladies&rsquo; days&rdquo;
Paleologue&rsquo;s canvas had to be removed for the
occasion.&nbsp; Knowing who some of the ladies were, and
understanding something also of the characteristics of the
committee-men who succeeded in carrying this proposal, the
arrangement always struck me as being particularly quaint and
insular.</p>
<p>One of the paintings of Julian Price was an inimitably clever
likeness of Drummond, our head-waiter.&nbsp; No man was ever half
so respectable as Drummond looked; and Price has caught his mild,
inquiring, deprecatory expression to a nicety.&nbsp; His trim
black whispers increase the pallor of his face, and, to mark the
members&rsquo; appreciation of his high reputation, the artist
has endowed him with a halo.&nbsp; We had taken Drummond on from
the Raleigh Club.&nbsp; In carrying out his duties, Drummond was
unaffected by the circumstances passing around him.&nbsp; The
most mirth-provoking joke might be let off in his presence, but
Drummond never turned a hair.&nbsp; When joking took a practical
turn, and when he became the subject of the joke, affairs took on
another complexion.&nbsp; And Drummond&rsquo;s reason for
resigning at the Raleigh was&mdash;or was said to be&mdash;that
Lord Marcus Beresford, in an access of boyish irresponsibility,
had put Drummond into the ice-chest, shut the lid on him, and had
then forgotten all about him.&nbsp; Fortunately, another waiter
had occasion to go to the refrigerator before a fatality
occurred, or poor Drummond would have become just so many pounds
of frozen meat.</p>
<p>This extraordinary man, notwithstanding his serious mood, was
the most painstaking, obliging, and solicitous club waiter I have
ever met.&nbsp; He understood the gastronomic tastes of every
member, and was infinitely desirous of giving satisfaction.&nbsp;
He had one or two curious methods of pronunciation; I believe
they had been imposed on him <a name="page161"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 161</span>by facetious members of the
Raleigh.&nbsp; Thus, he always said &ldquo;sooty&rdquo; instead
of &ldquo;saut&eacute;.&rdquo;&nbsp; It became quite a habit to
ask Drummond what potatoes were ready, for the sake of hearing
his quaint version: &ldquo;What potatoes to-day,
Drummond?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Potatoes, sir?&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
biled, mashed, and sooty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Drummond&rsquo;s reason for accepting service at clubs which
remained open all night long, and frequently until four and five
in the morning, was a singular one.&nbsp; It seems that he was a
proper religious man, and held the office of deacon in connection
with some conventicle in the suburbs.&nbsp; In accepting a
position in a club where all-night sittings were the rule, he was
free for every Sunday.&nbsp; I have seldom heard of a man
sacrificing more for his religion&mdash;have you?&nbsp; If
Drummond be still alive, he must be an old man by now, and may
his declining years be peaceful!&nbsp; If he be dead, may the
turf lie light on him!</p>
<p>The safeguard of a strong committee will never stand between a
proprietary club and eventual extinction.&nbsp; One of the
strongest committees I have known was got together by Mr. Earn
Murray when he founded the United Arts Club.&nbsp; The promoter
was enterprising, sanguine, and ambitious.&nbsp; But the only two
private members of the club who ever succeeded in achieving
notoriety were &ldquo;Old Solomon,&rdquo; the racing tipster, and
Percy Lefroy, the murderer of Mr. Gold.</p>
<p>Our legislature, which always does things in a grandmotherly
sort of way, thought to purify the West End and suppress the
Cyprian by closing the night-houses in the Haymarket and in the
streets impinging thereon.&nbsp; The abolishing of those squalid
dens did not, indeed, result in her disestablishment, but in the
betterment of the conditions under which she carried on her sad
but&mdash;if the unco&rsquo; guid will permit the use of the word
in this relation&mdash;necessary calling.&nbsp; Phryne, like the
poor, we shall always have with us.&nbsp; The obvious duty of
society, therefore, is not to take measures for her suppression,
but measures for her amelioration and regulation.&nbsp; School
Board education and an acquired knowledge of the laws of hygiene
have done much for her.&nbsp; When one compares the toilet, the
costume, and <a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>the manners, of the <i>demi-mondaines</i> who nightly
frequent the back of the dress-circle of certain houses of
entertainment with the tawdry, over-painted, giggling, solicitous
creature of thirty years ago, then, and only then, can one
understand the gratifying change that has taken place in the
habitude of this inalienable excrescence on the body politic.</p>
<p>When the night-houses were closed, and the police instructed
to keep the West End streets clear at midnight, there opened,
here and there, clubs for the accommodation of Phryne and her
friends.&nbsp; So that the closing of the frowsy saloons in which
she had been wont to congregate was a blessing in disguise, and,
indeed, fixes the date of the gratifying amelioration in her
manners.&nbsp; For in the clubs a certain decorum was observed
even in the ballroom, which afforded the <i>raison
d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i> of social rialtos of the
small-hours.&nbsp; The proprietors saw to that; for the
recurrence of disturbance or the report of sinister incidents
might occasion a raid.&nbsp; Election to these clubs was not, as
may well be supposed, a very difficult matter.&nbsp; One was
proposed on the doorstep, seconded on the hall mat, and
unanimously elected a member in the cloak-room.&nbsp; But the men
&ldquo;on the door&rdquo; knew perfectly well whom to admit and
whom to dismiss.&nbsp; The bully, the exploiter of frailty, the
<i>souteneur</i>, were kept ruthlessly outside.&nbsp; Thus the
proprietor protected at once himself and his customers.&nbsp; He
ran a sort of <i>bon march&eacute;</i> in fact, where no
middleman operated between the goods and the patrons of the
exchange.</p>
<p>The children of Israel&mdash;whose mission in these later
years is to be both our paymasters and our panders&mdash;were
particularly zealous in the promotion of this kind of
<i>r&eacute;union boh&eacute;miene</i>.&nbsp; Belasco opened the
Supper Club in Percy Street, Tottenham Court Road.&nbsp; Sam
Cohen provided the &ldquo;Spooferies&rdquo; in Maiden Lane.&nbsp;
He had previously run the concern as a baccarat club, its useful
career in that direction having ended in a raid, and a
prosecution of the greatest number of persons ever called up at
Bow Street to answer a single charge.&nbsp; Sam must have been a
bit of a cynic in his way, for the house in which the
&ldquo;Spooferies&rdquo; met was next door to the Jewish
synagogue.&nbsp; A Hebrew named <a name="page163"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 163</span>Foster established a similar place
in Long Acre, and a coreligionist of his called Moore&mdash;a
euphuism, I apprehend, for Moses&mdash;opened the Waterloo Club
in Waterloo Place, Pall Mall.&nbsp; There were others.&nbsp; But
those I have named are the only ones of which I had a personal
knowledge.&nbsp; This admission may, I fear, horrify those
readers who are of the dawn of the century.&nbsp; I can assure my
prudish friends, however, that were I mischievously inclined I
could give them a list of names of persons who were at one time
young men about town, but who now occupy prominent positions in
the Senate, at the Bar, and, generally speaking, in the public
life of the country, who were to be seen, in the jocund years,
thoroughly enjoying themselves in such Bohemian society as was to
be found at the &ldquo;Spooferies&rdquo; or the Supper Club.</p>
<p>I can see&mdash;in my mind&rsquo;s eye, Horatio&mdash;some
adipose, sleek, and eminently respectable householder, some
Member of Parliament, London County Councillor, West End
physician, fashionable painter, or what not, who has taken up
these reminiscences to while away an hour.&nbsp; I can see this
staid citizen, this respectable family man, this stickler for
morality, this Justice of the Peace, and all the rest of it,
squirming as he reads the above passage.&nbsp; With a blush he
lays down the book, and, looking suspiciously around, murmurs:
&ldquo;Damn the fellow, he means <i>me</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; Yes, I
undoubtedly mean <i>you</i>.&nbsp; But you may read on without
apprehension, my excellent friend, for I am the soul of
discretion.&nbsp; Your early trespasses are safe.&nbsp; In return
I would only ask this: that, remembering that you and I have sown
some wild-oats in the same fallows, you should exercise a little
more common-sense and charity in dealing with the peccadilloes of
your juniors, and that, generally speaking, you would carry
yourself with a less pompous air of conscious rectitude.</p>

164</span>CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE JOKER</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are jokers and jokers.&nbsp;
Professors of the art of practical joking are disappearing before
an advancing civilization like the Red Indian of the Far
West.&nbsp; The evanishment of the verbal joker is due to a
deplorable shrinkage in the national sense of humour.&nbsp; There
will soon be left to us the joker which is the fifty-third card
in the pack, and is incapable of any sense or emotion
whatever.</p>
<p>But in the days of my vanity grown men carried with them into
a tun-bellied middle-age the fine flow of animal spirits and
inordinate capacity for fun which nowadays would be deprecated by
the well-regulated schoolboy.&nbsp; In Fleet Street one would
have thought that there would have been no time for any joking
beyond an occasional interchange of verbal pleasantries.&nbsp;
But even in that busy thoroughfare the practical joker
found&mdash;or made&mdash;occasions for the exercise of his
fearsome talents.</p>
<p>It is something of a truism to say that the real man is very
seldom the man as he is observed in his public appearances.&nbsp;
Who, for instance, who only knew Edmund O&rsquo;Donovan as the
learned writer of travel articles in the <i>Quarterly Review</i>,
the accomplished special correspondent of a one-time influential
daily, the honoured guest of savants, the respected lecturer
before Royal Societies&mdash;who, I say, who saw O&rsquo;Donovan
with his Society war-paint on could have imagined the wild,
undisciplined, half-mad, but wholly delightful creature that was
exhibited at intervals to Society in conventional garb.&nbsp; He
was the maddest and the most modest Irishman I ever met.&nbsp;
When he returned from his extraordinary adventures in Merv, he
did not put up at <a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>some swagger hotel in London, where he would be easily
accessible to Society intent on making him the lion of a
season.&nbsp; He lodged at a public-house in Holborn kept by a
fellow-countryman of his, named Peter Cowell.&nbsp; This house
was at the time known to the police in connection with the visits
of Irish patriots of the physical force party in national
politics.&nbsp; It was the resort of the scattered remnants of a
disintegrated Fenianism.</p>
<p>Cowell revered his strange guest, and when customers heard the
sounds of revolver practice in the upper part of the house, you
may be sure that he did not give his patrons the true explanation
of the noise.&nbsp; The fact was that O&rsquo;Donovan, in bed at
midday, had grown greatly annoyed at the crude art evinced in the
engravings that Cowell had hung upon his walls, and that he was
engaged in shooting those masterpieces into smithereens.&nbsp;
This revolver practice in his bedroom only ceased when there was
nothing breakable left to fire at.&nbsp; &ldquo;Glory be to
God!&rdquo; said Peter Cowell, in relating the circumstance to a
correspondent, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s not a pictur&rsquo; nor a
frame nor a utinshill of anny kyoind that Misther O&rsquo;Donovan
hasn&rsquo;t bruk <i>an&rsquo; ped for</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two foreign gentlemen who refused to give their names, but who
had some important intelligence to convey, called at my
office.&nbsp; I signalled down that I would see them.&nbsp; I
expected men in European garb.&nbsp; But the two weird creatures
who shuffled into my sanctum were clothed in undressed animal
skins reaching almost to their feet.&nbsp; They were shod in the
same material.&nbsp; And their head-dress was also a fur so
fashioned that only the eyes and nose of the individuals were
visible.&nbsp; The curious part of the equipment was that the
visitors carried pistols in their skin belts.&nbsp; I think that
it was this little circumstance that &ldquo;gave the show
away.&rdquo;&nbsp; I looked very hard at the taller of the two
men, and then, feeling sure in my surmise, I said cheerily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear O&rsquo;Donovan, how are you?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
delighted to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faith, I knew you&rsquo;d know me!&rdquo; he declared,
in a tone that entirely disguised his disappointment.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Come out and have a drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>Now,
this hospitable invitation placed me in something of a
dilemma.&nbsp; For in the first place I did not wish to offend
O&rsquo;Donovan by refusing, and in the second I had no desire to
walk up Fleet Street in the company of companions so strangely
clad.&nbsp; I suggested that, if O&rsquo;Donovan and his friend
would go on to the &ldquo;Cheese,&rdquo; I would follow when I
had finished writing the letter on which I was then busy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a beastly picture of Dizzy,&rdquo; said
O&rsquo;Donovan quietly.&nbsp; He had taken his revolver from his
belt, and was pointing with it to &ldquo;Ape&rsquo;s&rdquo;
cartoon of Beaconsfield which hung opposite my desk.</p>
<p>I understood the hint.&nbsp; I rose and accompanied my
remorseless friend.&nbsp; My worst anticipations were realized
when I reached the office door.&nbsp; Quite a large crowd of
Fleet Street loafers&mdash;and I think that in the Street of
Adventure we could have boasted of as many loafers to the square
yard as any thoroughfare in London&mdash;pressed round the
door.&nbsp; The Fleet Street loafer is often exhilarated by the
sight of strange visitors; but he had never yet seen visitors
quite so strange as these.&nbsp; The crowd did not make any
demonstration.&nbsp; But Cockney criticisms of the general
appearance of my companions were freely bandied about.&nbsp; We
had to cross the street and encounter the jibes of cab-drivers
and omnibus cads.&nbsp; The crowd followed us right up to the
doors of the tavern to which I had been invited.&nbsp; Here was
another assembly.&nbsp; For O&rsquo;Donovan had already visited
the Cheshire Cheese, and had announced his intention of returning
to lunch.&nbsp; I believe that old Moore had during that
afternoon the most anxious time of his life.&nbsp; The fun waxed
fast and furious.&nbsp; But there is safety in a multitude of any
kind, and the intrepid traveller had so many friends and admirers
in this gathering that I was soon able to slip away
unnoticed.</p>
<p>The man who accompanied O&rsquo;Donovan on this occasion was
Frank Power&mdash;one of the most accomplished humbugs that ever
made a way in life by means of a glib tongue, a vivid
imagination, and an entire absence of scruple of any kind.&nbsp;
O&rsquo;Donovan subsequently engaged him as secretary, and he was
to have accompanied his employer during the <a
name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>march with
Hicks Pasha.&nbsp; It was characteristic of Power that when the
march was made Power remained behind in Khartoum.&nbsp; He was
once mentioned in the House of Commons.&nbsp; A question was
asked by an Irish Member as to the qualifications of Mr. Frank
Power, who had contrived to get himself made British Consul at
Khartoum.&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone, whose imagination was at times as
vivid as that of Power himself, replied promptly that the
gentleman in question was an &ldquo;esteemed merchant&rdquo; of
that city.</p>
<p>In letters home, O&rsquo;Donovan freely expressed his belief
that the chances of his ever returning to England alive were
extremely small.&nbsp; It is inconceivable that he should not
have communicated this opinion to Power.&nbsp; That young
gentleman, holding that discretion is the better part of valour,
had an attack of dysentery at the very moment when his services
should have&mdash;under ordinary circumstances&mdash;become of
any value to his chief.&nbsp; He did not accompany the intrepid
column that marched across the sands to inevitable and complete
annihilation.&nbsp; As to O&rsquo;Donovan, I know that he died as
he would have wished to die.&nbsp; No survivor of that ill-fated
expedition was allowed to escape with the story of the
fight.&nbsp; But I can picture O&rsquo;Donovan in the midst of
the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e, his eyes bright with the fury of battle,
his wild Irish &ldquo;Whirroo!&rdquo; appalling even his frantic
assailants, his desperate play with revolver, his final collapse
on the hot bosom of Mother Earth, his warm Irish blood reddening
the sands of the African desert.</p>
<p>John Augustus O&rsquo;Shea, of the <i>Standard</i>, was
another war-correspondent who was very much given to practical
joking, and disguise generally played a prominent part in his
plans.&nbsp; On one occasion he was commissioned by his editor to
describe a certain Lord Mayor&rsquo;s Show.&nbsp; Elephants were
to play a part in this particular pageant; and it occurred to the
accomplished correspondent that from the back of an elephant he
might obtain an unrivalled view of the rivals of the route.&nbsp;
George Sanger was providing the elephants, and O&rsquo;Shea
experienced no difficulty in obtaining permission to ride in a
howdah and illustrate the fidelity of Indian Princes to the
Empire.&nbsp; Sanger was also able to provide the <a
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>Oriental
costume essential to the part, together with the stage diamonds
without which no self-respecting Prince ever goes out
elephant-riding.&nbsp; His face was made up to the proper tint;
his turban was a triumph of millinery; and as O&rsquo;Shea passed
through Fleet Street in the character of an Eastern potentate,
and in the train of a London Lord Mayor, not a soul recognized
him.</p>
<p>Indeed, the completeness of the disguise led to some
inconvenience.&nbsp; For when the show was at an end, and
O&rsquo;Shea went on his elephant to Sanger&rsquo;s stables in
the Westminster Bridge Road, he found himself pressed for time,
and unable, therefore, to abandon his disguise.&nbsp; He got into
a hansom just as he was, and drove off to Shoe Lane to write his
descriptive article for the <i>Evening Standard</i>.&nbsp; He was
about to pass the commissionaire who stood sentry at the office
door.&nbsp; But that old soldier did not recognize a member of
the staff in the garb of a pious Hindu, and O&rsquo;Shea, unable
to curb his love of practical joking, soundly rated the old
soldier in an improvised gibberish which the warrior, no doubt,
thought he recognized as something he had been acquainted with in
the East.&nbsp; O&rsquo;Shea endeavoured to push past.&nbsp; The
man &ldquo;on the door&rdquo; barred his progress.&nbsp; The war
of strange words between them grew loud and furious.&nbsp; The
commissionaire called to a member of the crowd that was gathering
round the door to go for the police, and upstairs the sub-editor
was anxiously waiting for O&rsquo;Shea&rsquo;s copy.</p>
<p>Before the police could arrive Gilbert Venables came on the
scene, recognized the correspondent under the disguise of the
dusky Indian, and explained matters to the faithful
doorkeeper.&nbsp; The anxiety of the sub-editor was soon
appeased, and O&rsquo;Shea sat down to reel off a column of
humorous descriptive copy such as he alone on that staff could
produce.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Giniral&rdquo;&mdash;as O&rsquo;Shea
was called in Fleet Street&mdash;was one of those strange men who
think that it is never time to go to bed.&nbsp; Even when he got
home in the small-hours he never felt inclined to &ldquo;turn
in.&rdquo;&nbsp; And as he never could do without company of some
sort, he bought an owl.&nbsp; This bird he installed in his
&ldquo;study,&rdquo; and when <a name="page169"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 169</span>he went home in the morning he
related some of the more piquant experiences of the day to the
wise-looking fowl.&nbsp; When the owl exhibited any signs of
inattention or betrayed symptoms of sleepiness, O&rsquo;Shea
would recall him to a sense of his responsibilities by throwing a
slipper or any other handy missile at his feathered
companion.&nbsp; As some of these missiles hit their mark, the
life of the sagacious bird was neither peaceful nor
protracted.</p>
<p>On one occasion the festive little correspondent was sent into
the country to describe a two-day function, the exact nature of
which I forget.&nbsp; On the morning of the second day another
representative of the London Press gave a breakfast at his hotel
to some of his colleagues.&nbsp; Those invited were of the
swagger order of pressmen&mdash;Bernard Becker, Harry Pearse,
Godfrey Turner, Edmund Yates, and some others.&nbsp; O&rsquo;Shea
heard of this social function, and, I dare say, rather resented
the fact that he had not been invited.&nbsp; He got there,
however, for in the middle of the meal O&rsquo;Shea&rsquo;s card
was brought in to the founder of the feast.&nbsp; The host did
the only thing he could do under the circumstance: he desired the
visitor to be shown in.&nbsp; After a few minutes something was
heard rumbling along the hotel passage.&nbsp; The door of the
sitting-room in which O&rsquo;Shea&rsquo;s distinguished
contemporaries were breakfasting was thrown open, a Bath-chair
was trundled into the apartment by a couple of men, and in the
Bath-chair sat O&rsquo;Shea, a red Gibus on his head, a
churchwarden pipe in his mouth, and on his wrists a pair of
handcuffs.&nbsp; These he held up to us appealingly.&nbsp; But it
suited him to pretend to be a deaf-mute, and his companions
explained that the gentleman was a little mad, that they were his
keepers, and that, as it was dangerous to thwart him, they were
bound to accede to his request to be shown in to the present
distinguished party.</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Shea kept the game up for a long time.&nbsp; He
resisted all efforts to induce him to appear <i>in propria
persona</i> and sit down at table.&nbsp; He shook his head, he
made queer guttural noises, and when he felt that he had entirely
upset everybody he made signs to his companions to wheel him
away.&nbsp; He was taken from the hotel to the public promenade,
<a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>and was
driven up and down that select area, still in red Gibus,
handcuffs, and long clay pipe, followed everywhere by an
interested crowd.&nbsp; Eventually the police interfered, and in
the afternoon &ldquo;the Giniral&rdquo; appeared before the
scandalized breakfast-party of the morning clothed and in his
right mind.</p>
<p>A powerful practical joke of a double-barrelled kind was
played by a Fleet Street artist, and got into the papers of the
time.&nbsp; There were two black-and-white artists in the Street
of Adventure.&nbsp; One was H. Furniss with an &ldquo;i&rdquo;;
the other was H. Furness with an &ldquo;e.&rdquo;&nbsp; The one
was an Irishman; the other was a Yorkshireman.&nbsp; The latter
was the perpetrator of the joke.&nbsp; Joseph Biggar, the
well-known Parliamentary obstructionist, was so unfortunate as to
have been made the defendant in an action for breach of promise
of marriage.&nbsp; What was still more unfortunate was that he
lost his case, and was cast in heavy damages.&nbsp; Furness (with
an &ldquo;e&rdquo;) herein saw an opening.&nbsp; He drew a cheque
for the amount of the damages incurred, and forwarded it to Jo
Biggar in a letter glowing with expressions of sympathy and
admiration.&nbsp; Biggar attributed this act of princely
generosity to Furniss (with an &ldquo;i&rdquo;), and sent to that
gentleman an acknowledgment of his great indebtedness.&nbsp;
Meanwhile the joker had stopped his cheque at the bank, and Jo
Biggar had given the correspondence&mdash;the donor&rsquo;s
letter and his own reply&mdash;to the Press.&nbsp; Biggar was
covered with shame, Furniss (with an &ldquo;i&rdquo;) was aroused
to indignation, and Furness (with an &ldquo;e&rdquo;) had proved
himself&mdash;as is the nature of furnaces, however
spelt&mdash;to be very hot stuff.</p>
<p>But it was among my theatrical friends that I found the most
patient, enterprising, and scientific prosecutors of humour in
action.&nbsp; J. L. Toole was very fond of the practical
joke.&nbsp; But he did not carry his schemes out on the generous
scale that seemed the proper proportions to certain of his
colleagues.&nbsp; His jokes were small personal affairs, never
calculated to give pain or annoyance, and invariably described in
some paper or another.&nbsp; &ldquo;How <i>do</i> these things
get into the papers?&rdquo;&nbsp; Sothern was a past-master in
the <a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>fine
art of practical joking.&nbsp; Some of his most notorious
successes in that line have been narrated in works of biography
or autobiography by other men.&nbsp; But I was a witness of two
of his efforts in this way which I have never seen described in
print.&nbsp; They indicate the time, thought, and pains, which
Sothern was always prepared to spend over the elaboration of a
practical joke in order that it might eventually be presented
complete and perfect.&nbsp; He possessed a true actor&rsquo;s
faith in efficient rehearsal.</p>
<p>The breakfasts of Sam Rogers, the banker-poet, at the
beginning of the nineteenth century, may have been very
interesting reunions; but they could not have been half as
amusing as the breakfasts of Sothern given during the closing
years of that century.&nbsp; No one was invited to these
gatherings who was not either odd or interesting or witty.&nbsp;
The conversation was kept up to the mark by a host who could play
on the faculties of his guests as a musician on the strings of an
instrument.</p>
<p>One Sunday forenoon at Sothern&rsquo;s London
<i>pied-&agrave;-terre</i> in Vere Street, John Maclean, of the
Gaiety Theatre, was present.&nbsp; Maclean was what was called in
those days a &ldquo;useful actor.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was a
wonderfully fine mimic, and was particularly good at reproducing
the different shades of Irish and Scotch dialects in all their
varying enormity.&nbsp; He used to tell a story about George
Cordery, the property-master at the Theatre Royal, Dublin, and
Barry Sullivan, the tragedian, which introduced admirable
imitations of both those worthies.&nbsp; The story itself would
lose most of its point by translation into cold print.&nbsp; It
described an altercation between the tragedian and the
property-master as to the correct cue for the lowering of the
cauldron in &ldquo;Macbeth,&rdquo; Cordery insisting that
&ldquo;filthy &rsquo;ags&rdquo; was the cue, because he had been
so taught by his &ldquo;old mawster, Mister
Phellups&mdash;an&rsquo; &rsquo;e was a man as knew &rsquo;ow to
play Macbeth.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sullivan insisted on the cue being,
&ldquo;May eternal curses light upon you!&rdquo;&nbsp; At the
last rehearsal of the Witch scene, Barry Sullivan stalked over to
the trap through which the cauldron was to disappear, and called
down to the property-master:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know the cue <i>now</i>, Mr. Cordery?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
172</span>&ldquo;S&rsquo;wulp me, Goad!&rdquo; came back the
voice of the exasperated George, &ldquo;I shall never forgit
it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s &lsquo;May etarnal cusses light upon
you!&rsquo;&mdash;<i>meanin&rsquo; nothing personal to you</i>,
<i>Mr. Barry Soolivan</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The breakfast at an end and cigars lighted, there was always
experienced a feeling of suspense and expectancy.&nbsp; Sothern
requested Maclean to give his famous imitation of the tragedian
and the property-master.&nbsp; After the usual amount of demur,
Johnny rose to do as he had been bidden.&nbsp; Sothern placed his
victim on the hearthrug, where, with his back to the fire, he
could command the entire company, and where he was at the
farthest point from the entrance to the room.&nbsp; The gifted
imitator launched into his narrative, and soon had the assembly
in a roar.&nbsp; But just when he had come to the height of the
colloquy between the tragedian and his subordinate, the door of
the room was suddenly opened, and Sothern&rsquo;s man
announced:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Barry Sullivan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tragedian entered, bowing right and left, and shaking
hands with his host.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on with your recitation, Johnny!&rdquo; cried
Sothern.</p>
<p>But Maclean had collapsed and taken refuge behind the chair of
a friend.&nbsp; Nor was he greatly reconciled to the situation
when it was discovered that the new-comer was not Sullivan at
all, but a brother comedian made up for the part.</p>
<p>Another of Sothern&rsquo;s practical jokes was carried out
with the assistance of Sir Charles Wyndham&mdash;in those days
innocent of any pretensions to the accolade.&nbsp; This
particular experiment was six months in the working, and by the
elaborate means adopted its victim was kept on the tenterhooks of
suspense during all that time.&nbsp; The late Mr. Edgar Bruce,
then lately joined to the ranks of &ldquo;the profession,&rdquo;
was the unfortunate dupe.&nbsp; Bruce was an ambitious young
gentleman, and the joke was so contrived as to play on this
characteristic.&nbsp; It commenced in this way: Sothern had it
put about that he had been approached by the Russian Minister on
the possibility of getting together a company of English
comedians to play in St. Petersburg.&nbsp; He personally could
not accept the flattering command.&nbsp; He pretended <a
name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>to offer it
to Wyndham, and Wyndham handed the proposal on to Bruce.&nbsp;
Bruce jumped at it, and then, and for a period of six months, the
fun waxed fast and furious.&nbsp; Bruce was invited to meet the
Minister.&nbsp; An old nobleman smothered in orders, but having
no language but French and his native tongue, was introduced to
Bruce at a luncheon given for the purpose.&nbsp; At that time
Bruce had no French, and the conversation was carried on with
Wyndham as interpreter.&nbsp; Preliminaries were settled.&nbsp;
An agreement was signed.&nbsp; There remained nothing now but to
engage a company.&nbsp; Here again his good friends Wyndham and
Sothern came to the rescue.&nbsp; They made a careful selection
of actors and actresses who were let into the secret.</p>
<p>Eventually the affair got paragraphed in the newspapers.&nbsp;
The public was as greatly duped as Bruce himself, and those
interested in theatrical matters gossiped knowingly about the
visit of the English comedians to Russia.&nbsp; Constant devices
were adopted to raise, and sometimes to dash, the hopes of the
victim.&nbsp; Once Sothern borrowed a thousand pounds&rsquo;
worth of diamonds from his jeweller, and lent them to Miss Edith
Chalice&mdash;one of the supposed Bruce Company&mdash;who
exhibited them to the deluded victim as a gift from the Minister,
asking him to name any little souvenir he would desire for
himself from the same potentates.&nbsp; Bruce made his desires
known; but that was as far as the matter ever went in that
particular direction.</p>
<p>I was at a Bohemian party given by Val Bromley one night at
his studios in Bloomsbury Square, when there was an amusing
exhibition of the system adopted by Sothern and Wyndham to arouse
the anxiety of poor Bruce.&nbsp; All three of them happened to be
at this jolly function.&nbsp; At about one o&rsquo;clock in the
morning a sudden altercation broke out between Sothern and
Wyndham; they stood in the middle of the studio in attitudes of
menace, their voices were raised.&nbsp; &ldquo;Never dare to
speak to me again!&rdquo; shouted one of the angry men.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You are a contemptible scoundrel, sir!&rdquo; roared the
other.&nbsp; The war of words grew hot, the gestures more
threatening, and Bruce ran from friend to friend in the room,
crying: &ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake pacify them!&nbsp; <a
name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>My whole
future is ruined if those two men quarrel!&rdquo;&nbsp; He spoke
with the greatest emotion, and his face was deadly pale.&nbsp; At
length one of the disputants cried out: &ldquo;A friend of mine
will wait upon you in the morning, sir!&rdquo; and strode out of
the room, speedily followed by his brother-conspirator.&nbsp;
Soon after this the whole thing was &ldquo;given away&rdquo; by
one or other, or by both, of the authors of the joke.&nbsp; But
the curious part of the thing is that Edgar Bruce had for six
months so convinced himself that he was a manager that he could
not rid himself of the character.&nbsp; He had achieved the
reputation.&nbsp; He had, moreover, made openings for himself
among performers, costumiers, authors, and musicians.&nbsp; In
six months he had gained experience of the managerial methods,
and, being a manager in imagination, he crystallized into a
manager in reality.&nbsp; His first managerial experiment was, I
think, at the Royalty Theatre in Dean Street, Soho.&nbsp; Here he
engaged as his representative in front of the house a
comparatively unknown young man called Augustus Harris, little
imagining that he was employing an Augustus Druriolanus in the
making.&nbsp; He subsequently built the Lyric Theatre, and he
died a comparatively rich man.&nbsp; The theatrical career of
Edgar Bruce is the only practically good thing that I have known
to result from the playing of a practical joke.</p>
<p>These carefully-devised experiments on a large scale, becoming
known, naturally fired the ambition of imitators and a number of
gabies, whose only indication of humour consisted in the fatuous
smirk with which they greeted one in season and out of season,
set up as professors of the game.&nbsp; Certain of these
misguided young men formed themselves into a nomadic club called
&ldquo;The Who-bodies.&rdquo;&nbsp; But a better name for them
was invented by Wallis Mackay, who lashed them unmercifully in
his &ldquo;Captious Critic&rdquo; under the name of
&ldquo;Theodore Hooklings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The humour which is not of a practical kind appears to have
died away out of our literature, our legislature and our
judicature alike.&nbsp; Nay, it is fading out of our street life
with the disappearance of the omnibus cad and the driver of the
hansom.&nbsp; Even the gamin is losing his characteristic <a
name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>gaiety in
the solving of puzzles in his favourite publications or in
calculating the odds in turf handicaps.&nbsp; The last of the
Parliamentary wits was Bernal Osborne.&nbsp; He scintillated
before I entered on a journalistic career, but I well remember
the stimulation which the newspaper reports of his utterances
afforded me in my younger days.&nbsp; In contesting Waterford at
a General Election, he was opposed by Sir Patrick O&rsquo;Brien,
a very old man whose enunciation was not of the clearest.&nbsp;
Following the revered Baronet on the hustings, Osborne, exactly
mimicking the tones of his rival, commenced: &ldquo;Pity the
sorrows of a poor old man whose trembling limbs have borne him to
these hustings!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, addressing himself to one of
the nasty points of the other candidate&rsquo;s attack, he said:
&ldquo;But when the honourable Baronet describes me as the
rejected of seven constituencies, I hurl the accusation back in
his teeth&mdash;<i>if he has any</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; In the House
he was equally ready.&nbsp; Liskeard was among the constituencies
that had rejected him.&nbsp; A question arising regarding that
now happily disfranchised borough, it was referred to Bernal
Osborne.&nbsp; He immediately rose and said: &ldquo;I regret,
sir, that I am unable to recall any particulars respecting
<i>that highly respectable street</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; Viscount
Amberley was a small, baby-faced man.&nbsp; When he sat in
Parliament, and when Bernal Osborne was at the Admiralty,
Amberley asked some inconvenient question regarding that
Department.&nbsp; Osborne smilingly informed the House:
&ldquo;That is a matter which was settled when the honourable
Viscount was in his&mdash;er&mdash;perambulator!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bernal Osborne&rsquo;s patronymic was Bernal.&nbsp; He was a
Jew and the son of Mr. Ralph Bernal, who was for many years
Chairman of Committees in the House of Commons.&nbsp; He added
the name Osborne to his own on marrying Lady Osborne, with whom
he did not always agree.&nbsp; When he married he was a dashing
young officer and Aide-de-Camp to the Lord Lieutenant of
Ireland.&nbsp; I suppose he was not quite so successful in the
dull domestic round, for he and his wife led a cat-and-dog
life.&nbsp; They soon separated, and during the period of this
first grass-widowhood the lady wrote a novel in which her husband
was depicted, under a <a name="page176"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 176</span>thin disguise and in very lurid
colours.&nbsp; Society was greatly diverted.&nbsp; Bernal begged
his wife&rsquo;s forgiveness.&nbsp; A reconciliation was
effected, the novel was withdrawn from circulation, and Bernal
settled down once more as the model married man.&nbsp; The
vivacity of his disposition, however, and his great extravagance,
occasioned fresh quarrels.&nbsp; There was another separation,
succeeded shortly after by a reissue of the wife&rsquo;s literary
caricature of her refractory husband.</p>
<p>Bernal Osborne was what, in more heroic times than these, was
known as a &ldquo;diner-out&rdquo;&mdash;that is to say, a man
who was asked to dinner entirely on account of the sparkle of his
conversation.&nbsp; Nowadays the sparkle is the monopoly of the
champagne.&nbsp; The very last of the &ldquo;diners-out&rdquo;
was Father Healy of Bray, in County Wicklow.&nbsp; For some years
before his death, that wittiest of Irishmen was invited to London
during the season, and was to be met night after night at the
tables of the leaders of Society.&nbsp; He was a wit of parts,
and the curious thing about him was that he never for a moment
supposed that he owed his acceptance in Society to his wit and
humour.&nbsp; He always believed that the great ones of the earth
inviting him to their tables were anxious to ascertain his views
on Irish politics.&nbsp; Dining one night at the table of Lord
Ardilaun, he met a prelate of the Church of England.&nbsp; Healy
by no means appreciated the tone of easy condescension adopted by
the Bishop.&nbsp; His lordship was patronizing, and Healy
bitterly resented anything of the kind.&nbsp; He bided his
time.&nbsp; It came, as all things do to him who knows
how&mdash;and how long&mdash;to wait.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lived sixty years in this wicked
world,&rdquo; at length said the Bishop, smiling and expansive,
&ldquo;and I have never yet been able to see the difference
between a good Catholic and a good Protestant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faith, me lord,&rdquo; answered Healy, &ldquo;you
won&rsquo;t be sixty seconds in the next before you&rsquo;ll know
all about it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dowse is a name utterly forgotten by the present
generation.&nbsp; Yet Dowse afforded a great deal of occupation
to the pressmen of his day in reporting his sayings.&nbsp; He was
a rough-looking Irishman, red-headed and rotund.&nbsp;
Originally, as a boy, he had herded goats about the mountains
near <a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span>Dungannon.&nbsp; He contrived, however, to get an
education, read for the Irish Bar, was duly called, became
Solicitor-General for Ireland, and, in the fulness of time, Chief
Baron of the Irish Exchequer.&nbsp; He was famous for his
&ldquo;bulls,&rdquo; and when in the House of Commons succeeded
in introducing one at least before which those of Sir Boyle Roche
are simply negligible.&nbsp; A question was put to him, while he
was Solicitor-General, respecting certain religious riots that
had broken out in Londonderry.&nbsp; Dowse explained that the
riots had been occasioned by the ceremony connected with the
&ldquo;shutting of the gates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;is an anniversary
that takes place twice a year in Derry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bernal Osborne has been, I confess, rather irrelevantly
introduced into this chapter, for I never knew him.&nbsp; But I
had the honour of knowing Baron Dowse.&nbsp; And I enjoyed the
still greater privilege of dining at the table of Father Healy,
to whom I was introduced by Mr. John Gunn, of the Gaiety Theatre,
Dublin.&nbsp; Healy was one of the handsomest as Dowse was one of
the ugliest of men.</p>
<p>The illustration of the science of humour on the judicial
bench is now the province of ermined jokers.&nbsp; Perhaps
nothing could give a more vivid idea of the decadence of the
bench in this respect than a comparison of the Ally Sloperian
japes of certain living judges with the polished shafts of the
late Lord Justice Bowen.&nbsp; Lord Bowen&rsquo;s was the true
Attic salt.&nbsp; And because he knew its quality, he never
offered it to either the groundlings or the gallery.&nbsp; The
reappearance of his shafts&mdash;bright and polished as they
were&mdash;only caused him to shudder, even when followed in the
newspaper by the reportorial &ldquo;(laughter).&rdquo;&nbsp; To
some of our Judges, the constant appearance in the columns of
their jokes, followed by &ldquo;laughter&rdquo; in brackets,
would appear to be a chief end of their existence.&nbsp; Indeed,
a Judge, quite recently dead, has occasionally supplied me, what
time I sat in an editorial chair, with little impromptus which he
has let off in the course of the day.&nbsp; For verily all is
vanity.</p>
<p>Two examples of Lord Bowen&rsquo;s wit may be recorded
here.&nbsp; Bowen was a Liberal in politics, but, like a great
many <a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
178</span>other thinking men, he deserted his party when Mr.
Gladstone introduced his Home Rule Bill.&nbsp; Tackled by one who
regarded him as guilty of political apostasy, and challenged as
to his then opinion of Mr. Gladstone, he replied, in those
mincing, modulated tones which he had acquired at Balliol:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s is one of the greatest and most
complex minds of our time.&nbsp; He possesses all the apostolic
fervour of St. Paul with all the moral obliquity of
Ananias.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the occasion of the Jubilee of Her late Majesty Queen
Victoria, the Judges met to decide on an address from their body
to be presented to their Sovereign.&nbsp; A draft was submitted
by one of their number.&nbsp; It commenced with the words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam, conscious as we are of our own
infirmities.&rdquo;&nbsp; But immediate objection was taken by
their lordships to this opening, and suggestions were
invited.&nbsp; The measured calculated drawl of Bowen made itself
heard:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose we substitute for the paragraph this:
&lsquo;Conscious as we are of one another&rsquo;s
infirmities!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Commissioner Kerr was a Judge whose rasping voice and
strong Glasgow accent issued from the bench of my time utterances
both strange and strong.&nbsp; The old gentleman was, in effect,
brutally rude, and that&rsquo;s a fact.&nbsp; He was particularly
hard on solicitors.&nbsp; On one occasion I heard him open a
charge in this way:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are a number of hairpies who infest this
coort.&nbsp; An&rsquo; when I use the words
&lsquo;hairpies,&rsquo; I do not wish to be meesunderstood.&nbsp;
I refer to the soleecitors who lie in wait about the corridors of
the coort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was present also when the following colloquy took place
between the bench and a perfectly respectable witness to whom
Kerr had evidently taken an instinctive dislike:</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kerr</span>: &ldquo;What air
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a
merchant.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kerr</span>: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your
mairchandise?&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an
importer of lemons.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kerr</span>: &ldquo;An importher of
lemons!&nbsp; Why, ye ken you&rsquo;re naething mair nor less
than a huckster!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewis Glyn the barrister, whom Kerr hated to see come <a
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>into his
court, once got very much the better of the learned
Commissioner.&nbsp; Glyn, in addressing the court, had indulged
in a French expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk the Queen&rsquo;s English, Misther Glyn.&nbsp; We
don&rsquo;t want anny of your bad French in this coort,&rdquo;
snapped out the Commissioner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your Honour&rsquo;s pardon, but I thought that by
this time the court had become so accustomed to strange dialects
that one more or less would not matter,&rdquo; answered Glyn
sweetly.</p>
<p>But though rude and brusque in the extreme, Kerr was a sound
lawyer and a strong Judge.&nbsp; It must be recalled to his
credit, also, that he was invariably the champion of the poor and
oppressed who appeared before him.&nbsp; He was down on usurers,
and his constant attacks on the immunity of those plunderers of
the poor, under the law as it existed, did much to hasten the
reform in the legislature&mdash;small as it is&mdash;under which
money-lenders now ply their calling.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly the most colossal joker of my time was that huge
mountain of flesh who came from the antipodes to claim the title
and estates of the Tichborne family.&nbsp; When that obese
impostor copied from Miss Braddon&rsquo;s novel the inspiring
sentence, &ldquo;Them as has money and no branes was made for
them as has branes and no money,&rdquo; he declared the spirit in
which he played the game.&nbsp; He must have enjoyed the joke
immensely&mdash;while it lasted.&nbsp; And it lasted long enough,
unfortunately, to ruin the twelve jurymen who sat for the greater
part of a year on the second trial.</p>
<p>Whether the Claimant was really Arthur Orton or Castro I never
troubled myself to determine.&nbsp; That he was not Tichborne,
or, indeed, a gentleman of any degree whatever, I satisfied
myself at my first interview with him.&nbsp; It was during the
trial before the Lord Chief Justice, Sir Alexander Cockburn, and
I was as yet a novice in Fleet Street.&nbsp; Mr. G. W. Whalley,
the eccentric Member for Peterborough, was an acquaintance of
mine, and he believed that were I to meet the Claimant I would be
convinced that he was Roger Tichborne, and that I would do my
little utmost for him on the Press.&nbsp; Whalley was a
tremendous Protestant, <a name="page180"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 180</span>anti-Ritualist, and &ldquo;no
Popery&rdquo; man, and I believe that he espoused the cause of
the Wapping butcher from Wagga-Wagga, not because he was in any
degree attracted by him but because he believed him to be the
victim of a gigantic Jesuitical intrigue in which Parliament, the
Judicial Bench, and the British Press, were all concerned to keep
the man out of his own.</p>
<p>Whalley took me to visit his adipose prot&eacute;g&eacute; in
a street in Pimlico.&nbsp; I think it was called Bessborough
Street; I recollect that it was a continuation of Tachbrook
Street.&nbsp; Here &ldquo;Sir Roger&rdquo; had installed Miss
Norrie Jordan, a member of the chorus at the Globe Theatre, in
control of his domestic arrangements, &ldquo;Lady
Tichborne&rdquo; being provided for elsewhere.&nbsp; This was
quite characteristic of the Claimant.&nbsp; He had not the
slightest affection for Miss Jordan, and appeared to feel
uncomfortable in her presence.&nbsp; But it was the fashion for
gentlemen of title to run &ldquo;side-shows,&rdquo; as they were
called; and &ldquo;Sir Roger&rdquo; was determined to stand by
his order, and show himself a man sensitive to the slightest
movements of Society, however personally unpleasant to himself
the experiments involved might be.</p>
<p>My subsequent meetings with the fellow proved to me that the
sum of his so-called accomplishments might be set down in a line
or two.&nbsp; He had an unbounded capacity for swallowing
gin-and-soda; he had a good eye and a steady hand as a
pigeon-shot; and he possessed an unrivalled faculty for
exploiting &ldquo;mugs.&rdquo;&nbsp; In dealing with possible
subscribers to the Tichborne &ldquo;stock,&rdquo; it was a
favourite ruse of his to ask the intended victim to try on the
Claimant&rsquo;s gloves.&nbsp; This trial proved that the hands
of the Claimant were small, whereas those of Orton were
<i>said</i> to have been large.&nbsp; When the &ldquo;unfortunate
nobleman&rdquo; went to Dartmoor to &ldquo;languish&rdquo; for a
term of years, it was a great relief to the Press and an infinite
advantage to the community at large.</p>
<p>He had indeed proved himself the very Prince of Jokers, but
his joke had begun to pall.</p>

181</span>CHAPTER XII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">ANSDELL&rsquo;S AFTERNOONS</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">James Ansdell</span> was a retired Cape
merchant.&nbsp; He was a genial, generous, and clever little man,
and bore a somewhat striking facial resemblance to Livingstone
the explorer.&nbsp; Why on earth James Ansdell, with a fine
income and all the world open to him as an oblate spheroid of a
pleasure-garden, should have selected Anderton&rsquo;s Hotel in
Fleet Street as the resort, of all others, to afford him the
greatest amount of diversion, I have never been able to
discover.&nbsp; But in the smoking-room of Anderton&rsquo;s some
five-and-twenty years ago Ansdell was to be found on every
afternoon after lunch, surrounded by a little coterie of
pressmen, Fleet Street nondescripts, and Cape cronies.&nbsp; He
established himself as host of the table; and in those days that
in itself was a passport to the less strenuously occupied of the
journalists.&nbsp; Ansdell was always sure of a full company, and
as he was not only a good talker, but a good listener,
conversation for conversation&rsquo;s sake was greatly
encouraged, and time passed swiftly and agreeably enough over the
Cape merchant&rsquo;s coffees and whiskies and cigars.</p>
<p>Ansdell had met Alfred Geary at the Cape&mdash;about Geary I
shall have a little to say in my next chapter&mdash;and I suppose
that to Geary he was indebted for the introductions which enabled
him to establish his &ldquo;afternoons.&rdquo;&nbsp; My
opportunities of joining Ansdell&rsquo;s circle were
infrequent.&nbsp; The journalist of larger leisure, a smaller
sense of responsibility, and more mercurial temperament, found
the Ansdell reunions extremely to his taste.&nbsp; And there can
be no doubt that the founder of the &ldquo;afternoons&rdquo; had
contrived to surround himself with some very interesting
characters.</p>
<p><a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>Among
them was a certain poet.&nbsp; The world forgets all about
him&mdash;a tasteless and an ungrateful world&mdash;but in the
seventies and eighties no new publication would consider itself
complete that did not contain a copy of verse from his
muse.&nbsp; And if he had been Horace himself, he could not have
had a more profound belief in the authenticity of his poetic
gift.&nbsp; He had a stout figure, a round red face, and he
walked up and down the Street that is called Fleet with his head
held well back, and with the severe air of a man that was
determined to bring the beast of a British Public to its
knees.&nbsp; I am afraid the good fellow was chaffed considerably
at the Ansdell symposia.&nbsp; But his belief in his own good
gifts was too profound to permit him to take offence even at the
most obvious irony.</p>
<p>The last occasion on which I saw the poet was on the day on
which the papers announced that the Laureateship, vacant for some
time by the death of Tennyson, had been bestowed upon Mr.
Austin.&nbsp; He was overwhelmed with grief and
chagrin&mdash;grief, that a post so manifestly adapted to his own
genius should have been given to another; chagrin, because the
office had been given to one whom he regarded as his own
inferior.&nbsp; His idea was that I should obtain for him
permission, from the conductors of a journal with which I was
then connected, to write the new appointment down.&nbsp; He was
greatly incensed, I remember, by my asking him whether it
mattered very much who was appointed or whether any appointment
whatever were made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the cynical act of a Minister who has made
science his hobby.&nbsp; What sort of a taste for literature can
be expected to be acquired in Lord Salisbury&rsquo;s laboratories
at Hatfield?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A taste for literary retorts,&rdquo; I suggested.&nbsp;
But he would not allow the momentous subject to be side-tracked
by a mere verbal pleasantry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; he persisted, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a
filthy political job.&nbsp; Austin has been officially honoured,
not on account of his poems, but as a reward for his Conservative
leaders in the <i>Standard</i>.&nbsp; This great office has been
flung like a bone to a dog by a cynical and unscrupulous
Minister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was strange, the way he harped on poor Lord
Salisbury&rsquo;s <a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>cynicism.&nbsp; But I was unable to obtain for him the
hearing he desired, and I do not expect that it was accorded to
him elsewhere.</p>
<p>The most picturesque figure at these informal assemblies was
Brigadier-General McIver.&nbsp; In what service this Caledonian
swashbuckler earned his last distinction I forget, but the reader
will find the details in an autobiography of the General entitled
&ldquo;Under Fourteen Flags.&rdquo;&nbsp; From the very title of
the book it will be deduced that the General was impartial in his
sympathies, and that his good sword was at the disposal of any
nationality that was disposed to pay for it.&nbsp; In that
autobiographical work the author is somewhat reticent about his
life previous to the date at which he received his first
command.&nbsp; From personal observation of the gallant officer,
I should be inclined to say that he had served in the ranks as a
British Tommy, and that, having a real taste for soldiering, and
finding the rate of promotion in the ranks vastly too slow for
his aspirations, he had left the home forces, and placed his
services at the disposal of those struggling nationalities which
are so often only too glad to accord high commissions to
Englishmen or Scotsmen or Irishmen willing to serve under their
flags.&nbsp; His whole bearing, dialect, and appearance, was that
of the ranker.</p>
<p>His book, which was really written for him by an English
officer &ldquo;down on his luck,&rdquo; is an amazing record of
deeds of derring-do in Servia, in Turkey, in the Far East, and in
the republics of South America.&nbsp; It was all one to
McIver.&nbsp; A soldier of fortune, it mattered nothing to him
whose blood he was called upon to shed, provided he was allowed
to shed a great deal of it.&nbsp; Had the deeds which the
Brigadier-General has had recorded in his name been performed
under the British flag, the intrepid warrior should have earned
the Victoria Cross, perhaps a peerage, and certain such a money
grant as would have made him quite comfortable for the rest of
his natural life.&nbsp; The struggling nationalities, apparently,
had all been either ungrateful or impecunious, and McIver was in
the habit of drawing on the resources of his generous entertainer
from the Cape.&nbsp; That worthy individual was quite ready to
meet these recurrent demands, <a name="page184"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 184</span>persuaded that in listening to the
lurid romances of the General he was receiving rather more than
value for his money.</p>
<p>The successes of the gallant General in war were only less
renowned than his successes in love&mdash;that is to say, from
the General&rsquo;s own not very lofty point of view.&nbsp; His
intrigues were, indeed, of a somewhat squalid character,
occasionally involving the professional disqualification of the
&ldquo;slavey&rdquo; at his lodgings, and his own temporary
disappearance from his Fleet Street haunts.</p>
<p>He was a tall, muscular, well-knit, soldierly-looking man with
a cavalry moustache and big imperial.&nbsp; His accent was that
of the Lowland Scot.&nbsp; On one of Ansdell&rsquo;s afternoons
the General, &ldquo;intoxicated,&rdquo; to use a famous phrase,
&ldquo;by the exuberance of his own verbosity,&rdquo; or from
other causes, retired from the convivial circle, and stretched
himself out to rest on a couch at the end of the room.&nbsp;
While &ldquo;he lay like a warrior taking his rest,&rdquo; some
habitu&eacute;s of the room decorated the face of the sleeping
hero with burnt cork and red paint, and when their artistic work
had been effected McIver looked more like a Sioux Indian on the
war-path than a Scots free-lance seeking repose.&nbsp; Hours
afterwards he woke, and found himself in a smoking-room now
filled with strangers.&nbsp; A loud laugh greeted his appearance
when he arose&mdash;a giant refreshed.&nbsp; There could be no
mistake that the laughter was directed against him.&nbsp; In his
most heroic vein he demanded the cause of the company&rsquo;s
hilarity, and was referred to the mirror that was fixed above the
fireplace.</p>
<p>A wild Scottish whoop came from his throat.&nbsp; He turned on
the assembly with a fierce expression and a commanding
gesture.&nbsp; The laughter of the room broke out afresh.&nbsp;
McIver was speechless with rage.&nbsp; He rushed from the
place.&nbsp; But he was staying in the hotel at the time, and in
half an hour returned in the opera-bouffe costume of a
Brigadier-General in the army of a struggling nationality.&nbsp;
He had washed the paint and charcoal from his face.&nbsp; He
stood in the midst of the grinning assembly, and, drawing his
sword, he inquired in an awful voice for the name of the
perpetrator of the dastardly outrage, manifestly intent on
cleaving that caitiff from helm to chine.&nbsp; But a fresh roar
of inextinguishable <a name="page185"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 185</span>laughter greeted his
challenge.&nbsp; In the pages of &ldquo;Under Fourteen
Flags&rdquo; he would have fallen upon that ribald crowd, cutting
the infidels down man by man.&nbsp; In Fleet Street such a course
was inexpedient.&nbsp; The <i>beau sabreur</i>, casting on the
mockers a glance of superb disdain, exclaimed, &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re
a pauck o&rsquo; scoundrels sheltering a coward!&rdquo; and
stalked from the room with the air of a tragedy king, followed by
the gibes of the now irate &ldquo;scoundrels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gladstone&mdash;the G.O.M., I mean&mdash;was accustomed to
ask strange people to his breakfast-table.&nbsp; But no stranger
guest did he ever entertain than when McIver sat with him at that
meal to give the great statesman his experiences in the Balkan
States.&nbsp; Gladstone welcomed anyone who could give him the
slightest information regarding what were known in the eighties
as &ldquo;Bulgarian atrocities,&rdquo; and the Brigadier-General
returned to England reputedly abounding with reliable news from
that part of Europe.&nbsp; If Mr. Gladstone was greatly in the
habit of taking his facts about the Eastern Question from
authorities of the McIver kidney, it is little wonder that he led
his countrymen astray when he inflamed their passions on the
topic of atrocities with which he had become obsessed.</p>
<p>A year or two since I saw the death of the hero of the
&ldquo;Fourteen Flags&rdquo; announced in the <i>Daily
Telegraph</i>.&nbsp; It was followed by quite a flattering
obituary notice of the deceased officer.&nbsp; His many deeds of
valour were referred to in terms which must have made all his
friends regret that the tribute should have been delayed till the
man himself was no longer alive to read it.</p>
<p>I have quoted above the initials G.O.M. as applied to Mr.
Gladstone, and standing, of course, for &ldquo;Grand Old
Man.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another and less reverent reading of the
initials was given by one of Gladstone&rsquo;s most devoted
supporters, Mr. Labouchere.&nbsp; It must have been at a time
when the doctors had stopped &ldquo;Henry&rsquo;s&rdquo;
cigarettes, or perhaps during one of those periods of shuffling
the Ministerial cards when Labouchere felt annoyed at having his
claims to office once more disregarded.&nbsp; Whatever the cause,
to Mr. Henry Labouchere was quite rightly attributed the
translation of G.O.M. into &ldquo;God&rsquo;s only
mistake!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
186</span>Another of the regular members of the Ansdell circle
was Morgan Evans.&nbsp; Evans was as good a fellow and as sound a
journalist as ever tempted fortune in the Street of
Adventure.&nbsp; But, like many a cultured man, he drifted into
the wrong line&mdash;wrong, I mean, in so far as money-making is
concerned.&nbsp; In journalism, as in other professions, that man
makes most who specializes in certain subjects.&nbsp; Now, the
subject on which Evans had specialized was scientific
dairy-farming.&nbsp; In this study, his friendship with Professor
Duguid and other leading lights in the veterinary world was of
considerable service to him.&nbsp; The admirable series of
articles which he contributed to the <i>Field</i> created
widespread interest among those for whose edification they were
written, and Evans might have gone on for ever treating on that
subject and cognate ones in the <i>Field</i> and other papers
dealing with agriculture.&nbsp; Such a course meant abundance of
work at special rates.&nbsp; But Morgan Evans was a dreamer, and
preferred the position of a free-lance writing spasmodically on
general topics to that of the highly paid regular contributor on
scientific or semi-scientific subjects.</p>
<p>With a miserably insufficient capital, and possessing
absolutely no business capacity, Evans founded a monthly magazine
entitled <i>The Squire</i>.&nbsp; He did me the honour to consult
me about the prospects of such a venture.&nbsp; When I asked and
ascertained what was the amount of capital behind the
proposition, I strongly advised him to desist.&nbsp; It appeared
to me that the title was more suited to a weekly paper on the
lines of the <i>Field</i>, and I believed that if he would agree
to the scheme a sufficient capital could be obtained.&nbsp; But
Evans was impatient.&nbsp; He would hear of anything save
delay.&nbsp; Besides, it was evident that he wanted the organ to
be his own mouthpiece and under his own individual control.&nbsp;
And this could only be achieved by the employment of his own
capital.&nbsp; So he brought out the <i>Squire</i>, and his
friends rallied round him.&nbsp; H. H. S. Pearse wrote charming
articles about hunting; Vero Shaw wrote with interest and
authority about the dog; I believe I contributed some dramatic
articles.&nbsp; Evans himself wrote on general literature, and
Montgomerie Rankin produced the <a name="page187"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 187</span>inevitable verses.&nbsp; Every topic
in which a country gentleman might take an interest was dealt
with&mdash;except scientific dairy-farming!&nbsp; Evans had been
fed up with that subject, and devoted himself to essays entirely
detached from science of any sort.&nbsp; I forget who was
responsible for the rather neat and appropriate title for the
article dealing with the drama of the month; it was called
&ldquo;Partridge at the Play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>Squire</i> lived for six months, and then fizzled out,
the savings of poor old Morgan Evans having fizzled out
too.&nbsp; He then returned to the unprofitable, but more
congenial, r&ocirc;le of casual contributor to the Press.&nbsp;
During the last months of his life he did little and suffered
much, and the end came mercifully and quickly.&nbsp; Evans was a
rather short, yellow-bearded man, with a gentle voice and a most
engaging smile.&nbsp; He hailed from the Principality, but was
not at all of the type of Welshman that now affrights the
imagination of the English.</p>
<p>An occasional visitor to Ansdell&rsquo;s table was A. K.
Moore.&nbsp; At that time Moore also was among those who wielded
the free-lance.&nbsp; Among the journals that sometimes accepted
his contributions was <i>Punch</i>.&nbsp; But Fleet Street was a
long time discovering Moore&rsquo;s merits.&nbsp; He was a
graduate of Dublin University and a graduate of Oxford.&nbsp; He
was an Irishman, he possessed a fine sense of humour, wrote a
lucid, vigorous style, yet had to wait many years for a
recognition of his gifts.&nbsp; When at last &ldquo;he came into
his own&rdquo; by being appointed Editor of the <i>Morning
Post</i>, he proved himself to possess all that his journalistic
friends in Fleet Street claimed for him; but I imagine that it
was a man somewhat soured by waiting who took command in the
editorial sanctum of the <i>Post</i>.&nbsp; His duties were,
however, discharged not only with fidelity, but with conspicuous
ability, and the paper prospered greatly in his hands.&nbsp; He
died in harness.</p>
<p>There were two artists in the Ansdell entourage.&nbsp; The one
was Mat Stretch, the other George Cruikshank junior.&nbsp; Both
were contributors to the comic papers.&nbsp; The work of Mat
Stretch was at one time in great demand.&nbsp; He possessed a
vein of humour which was quite his own, and his drawings always
found a place in one or other of the humorous publications.&nbsp;
Cruikshank had a stiff style and an exaggerated <a
name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
188</span>method.&nbsp; I never could stand his work, nor,
indeed, did I care very much for the little creature
himself.&nbsp; He was by way of being a bit of a dandy.&nbsp; He
wore a very glossy silk hat tilted over one ear; his clothes were
usually of a sporting cut, and he affected the style of a patron
of the turf.&nbsp; Before the growing popularity of camera
pictures both he and Mat Stretch fell back.&nbsp; The camera, if
not artistic, is at least reliable, and any reliability which
Cruikshank might have at one time evinced became impaired by his
conviviality.&nbsp; It is to be feared, indeed, that he was not a
bigoted subscriber to the teetotal tenets of his illustrious
relative.&nbsp; George the Elder drew &ldquo;The
Bottle.&rdquo;&nbsp; George the Younger was fonder of drawing the
cork.</p>
<p>Ansdell, the chairman of these afternoon reunions, was a
widower.&nbsp; When he took to himself a second wife, Cruikshank
junior regarded it as something in the nature of a personal
affront that the permission of the circle at Anderton&rsquo;s had
not been obtained in the first place.&nbsp; Perhaps Ansdell knew
that George would never give his consent.&nbsp; At all events, he
got married without asking for it.&nbsp; The agreeable afternoon
functions were broken up, and Fleet Street knew James Ansdell no
more.</p>
<p>The smoking-room at Anderton&rsquo;s Hotel is abundantly
provided with windows at the back, and over the front part of it,
which is cut off from the back by a partition, there is a dome
light.&nbsp; But the place is so built in that the walls of
neighbouring erections cut off the sunlight, and on the brightest
days this particular apartment is always tenebrious.&nbsp; On
gloomy days the artificial lights are switched on.&nbsp; At
Anderton&rsquo;s Hotel the redoubtable Richard Pigott spent some
of the last days of his smirched career, and the smoking-room was
the favourite resort of the devoted forger.</p>
<p>Pigott&rsquo;s favourite position was at the writing-tables
under the glass skylight in the lower part of the room.&nbsp;
There he spent many hours of those days of the Parnell Commission
pending and during his call to the witness-box.&nbsp; I had
occasion to interview him on two occasions during this momentous
period&mdash;almost literally period&mdash;in his career.&nbsp; I
always found him writing away like mad and <a
name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>smiling
sweetly to himself the while.&nbsp; Never, surely, did the
results of a literary man&rsquo;s efforts yield so much immediate
pleasure to their author as Pigott&rsquo;s &ldquo;copy&rdquo;
seemed to afford to him.&nbsp; When I addressed him and explained
my desires, he gathered up his sheets of &ldquo;copy&rdquo; and
deposited them in a black leather bag which always accompanied
him.</p>
<p>He was a most benevolent-looking rascal.&nbsp; His white beard
and whiskers were carefully trimmed; his rubicund face was
invariably wreathed with smiles; his portly figure had an
aldermanic contour; and altogether he suggested the railway
director or the rich stage uncle.&nbsp; No one would have taken
him for the editor of a tenth-rate provincial paper, or the
clumsy forger who was so careless in his criminality as to sign
his victim&rsquo;s name at the top rather than at the bottom of a
letter on the acceptance of which everything depended.</p>
<p>Once I met him in Coventry Street late at night, and asked him
into the American Bar of the Criterion.&nbsp; He hesitated a good
deal before accepting my invitation, and was evidently ill at
ease while he remained there with me.&nbsp; He was greatly
disconcerted by the apparent interest which two men who were
drinking cocktails were taking in him.&nbsp; They certainly
looked our way and whispered together.&nbsp; Pigott took leave of
me hurriedly and left the place.&nbsp; I called on him next day,
desirous, if possible, of ascertaining his exact suspicion about
the men, whose presence had so obviously disturbed him, and their
connection with a conspiracy of which he was obviously in
dread.&nbsp; But Pigott could be as close as an oyster when he
desired.&nbsp; He assured me that he had not particularly noticed
anyone at the Criterion, and explained that he never really liked
the place.&nbsp; The &ldquo;company is so mixed, you see,&rdquo;
declared the venerable liar.</p>
<p>Pigott presented a strange psychological problem with singular
physiological developments.&nbsp; Immediately after the
appearance of his forgeries in the <i>Times</i>, he suddenly lost
flesh: the incessant smile and inflated waist had disappeared;
his face was haggard; he was but the shadow of his former
self.&nbsp; Pigott was a sick man.&nbsp; The thing accomplished,
fear possessed him and reacted on his body.&nbsp; But he put on
flesh again, and when he appeared before the Commission <a
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>he was the
same sleek, obese, oleaginous charlatan of former days.&nbsp; On
his oath he was as unctuous and specious as when off it, and
quite untrammelled by its obligations.</p>
<p>His flight to Spain, and his suicide when his pursuers were
close on his trail&mdash;these are matters of history.&nbsp; That
which is not quite a matter of history is an incident redounding
very much to the charity and humanity of Mr. Labouchere.&nbsp; It
will be recollected, perhaps, that the exposure and flight of the
traitor and forger were brought about at a conference which he
had with Sala and Labouchere at the house of the latter.&nbsp;
That which has gone unrecorded is that Labouchere charged himself
with the maintenance of the dead man&rsquo;s children.</p>
<p>It was curious to note the effect of the exposure of the
Pigott forgeries on the London public.&nbsp; The Man in the
Street came out very strong on the occasion.&nbsp; Up to that
time Parnell was a much-hated politician.&nbsp; But your Cockney
has fine sporting instincts always, and the finest instinct of
the sportsman is a love of fair-play.&nbsp; It was felt now that
a deadly wrong had been done to the leader of the Irish
people&mdash;for leader of the Irish party he never was and never
pretended to be.&nbsp; He led the people; but he drove the party
like a herd of pigs.&nbsp; I was on the steps of the Royal Courts
when Parnell came out after the disclosure.&nbsp; Quite a crowd
of people were assembled on the pavement.&nbsp; Parnell was
accompanied by George Lewis.&nbsp; On the appearance of the
lawyer and his client, quite a hearty cheer was raised.&nbsp; The
eminent solicitor&mdash;usually so impassive&mdash;was quite
evidently moved and pleased.&nbsp; But Parnell passed on
untouched, sphinx-like, contemptuous.&nbsp; As far as he was
concerned there might have been no demonstration, no expression
of sympathy, no British public at all.&nbsp; Tall, gaunt,
unbending, he moved on, a sad, lonely figure of a man, I
thought.&nbsp; His, however, was the immobility that covered a
very genuine sense of power.</p>
<p>After the divorce proceedings, which broke the rod of iron
with which he had hitherto ruled his so-called Parliamentary
following, had come to an end, the Irish tribune proceeded to his
native country to face the thing out in the constituencies.&nbsp;
<a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>A friend
of his and of mine met him on the platform at Euston Station,
and, on behalf of a news association, asked him to impart
something of his plans and views.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is there about which you particularly want to
know?&rdquo; asked Parnell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the interviewer, &ldquo;my people are
anxious to ascertain your present attitude with regard to Mr.
Gladstone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the old man?&rdquo; said Parnell coolly, and
dropping the &ldquo;grand&rdquo; which usually accompanied the
words.&nbsp; &ldquo;You can tell your people, if you like, that
the old man has made three mistakes with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the other eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first was when he put me into gaol; the second was
when he let me out; and the third was when he went into business
with me and thought to get the better of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I have wandered some few perches from
Anderton&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I return.&nbsp; My last visit to that
hotel was with the late Dr. Tanner, a Member for Mid-Cork.&nbsp;
His brother had committed suicide there by injecting
morphia.&nbsp; The deceased gentleman, Dr. Lombard Tanner, was an
extremely jovial and good-looking Irishman.&nbsp; He had got into
entanglements&mdash;not of a financial, but of the <i>other</i>
kind&mdash;and he saw no way out but this.&nbsp; I had been an
intimate friend of his.&nbsp; But he sought advice neither from
friends nor relatives.&nbsp; The memory for me will always remain
gruesome and ineffaceable.&nbsp; For before the inquest the
coroner&rsquo;s officer handed me a letter-card addressed to me
by poor Lombard, which was written, as to the first part, just
before he commenced the injection, and, as to the last part,
ending blurred and incoherent, while the drug was taking
effect.&nbsp; He wished me to accept his sword and certain other
effects which he had left at his room, in St. James&rsquo;s
Place, St. James&rsquo;s, and to bid me farewell!</p>
<p>This is, I confess, a sad note on which to close a chapter,
but even the most jocund periods have their short sharp moments
of tragedy.</p>
<h2><a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
192</span>CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">DE MORTUIS</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Fleet Street</span> is haunted by the
ghosts of dead newspapers.&nbsp; At midnight they flit&mdash;in
white sheets, of course&mdash;out of the doors and windows of old
offices in the thoroughfare itself, and in the tributary lanes
and streets and courts that flow into it.&nbsp; You may&mdash;if
you have a good reliable imagination&mdash;catch the glimmer of
their silent passage as they scurry back to their long
homes.&nbsp; Poor sheeted dead! once so full of life and hope and
confidence, but cut down untimely, and fated to revisit the
scenes of their short but well-meant labours!</p>
<p>When my time comes to go, I shall not be able to leave my
children much money; but I can&mdash;and will&mdash;leave them a
lot of good advice.&nbsp; Should one of them determine to try his
fortune in Fleet Street&mdash;a course which I should
deplore&mdash;I would advise that devoted child of mine to keep a
diary.&nbsp; Had I adopted this precaution, I should now be in a
position to fix an exact date to every incident and anecdote
related in these chronicles, and to record a hundred others which
have escaped my memory.&nbsp; And for the purposes of this
particular chapter I should be in a position to give the names,
dates, and careers, of all the dead newspapers I have known
during their brief stay on earth.</p>
<p>In the absence of any record, and having no desire to engage
in research at the British Museum, I should roughly compute the
number of publications started in my time and since died the
death at between forty and fifty.&nbsp; I confine myself in this
estimate to papers founded during the twenty years of my Press
experience, and issues with which I had <a
name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>some
intimate or remote personal connection.&nbsp; And here permit me
to give another crumb of advice to that unfortunate boy of mine
who may develop journalistic leanings.&nbsp; I would say to
him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son, when sinners entice thee to found a newpaper,
be sure you do not call it after the name of a bird.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That way disaster lies.&nbsp; There is ill luck in the
selection.&nbsp; Even <i>Chantecler</i> would fail to draw the
public if put on a Fleet Street publication.&nbsp; There is a
fatality about feathers.&nbsp; It has happened so, perhaps, since
journalists abandoned the goose-quill for the Gillott, the
pencil, and the stylus.&nbsp; But that it <i>is</i> so there can
be no manner of doubt.&nbsp; The smartest, breeziest, and
best-written little paper of which I have any recollection was
<i>The Owl</i>.&nbsp; It appeared only during the Parliamentary
session.&nbsp; It was a sort of co-operative concern carried on
by a group of able men in politics and Society.&nbsp; It came
somewhat before my time, and I am shaky in my recollections of
its short but brilliant career.&nbsp; I think Bowles fleshed his
maiden sword in its columns, and Hume Williams the Elder wrote in
it his &ldquo;Diary of a Disappointed Politician.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The other members of the group were persons of higher social
distinction.&nbsp; The profits of the issue were expended on
dinners at Greenwich&mdash;I wonder why people ever <i>did</i>
dine at Greenwich?&mdash;and on a box at the opera.&nbsp; But the
paper did not live, and now &ldquo;<i>The Owl</i>, for all his
feathers, is a&rsquo; cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>The Cuckoo</i> made its early flights with a strong
pinion.&nbsp; It was started as an evening paper by Edmund Yates,
and was frankly named after the predatory fowl because it made
free with the nests of its morning contemporaries.&nbsp; Yet in
truth it did not sin half so largely in this direction as the
other evening papers, and its original matter was smart, ably
written, and cheery.&nbsp; But who cares in these days to hear of
original matter in a paper?&nbsp; Nowadays matter doesn&rsquo;t
matter.&nbsp; From Yates the devoted <i>Cuckoo</i> passed, by
purchase, into the hands of my friend &ldquo;Jimmy&rdquo;
Davis.&nbsp; &ldquo;Jimmy,&rdquo; in his desire to make his
journal spicy, lowered its tone.&nbsp; He was very fond of
writing what he called &ldquo;snaky&rdquo; paragraphs, and too
ready to accept, without making due <a name="page194"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 194</span>inquiries, items of curious
information about people in Society.&nbsp; It was useless to
reason with him on the subject.&nbsp; A short time before the end
came I met the sub-editor in Fleet Street, evidently labouring
under a stress of emotion.&nbsp; I asked him what was the
matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t dry up we&rsquo;ll be smashed
tip,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look at this!&nbsp; He
insists on its going in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He,&rdquo; of course, was Davis, and &ldquo;it&rdquo;
was a paragraph dealing with the private life of a very great
lady indeed.&nbsp; This particular item got crushed out at the
last minute.&nbsp; But the risks of criminal libel run every day
by &ldquo;Jimmy&rdquo; would appal the modern journalist.&nbsp;
This notwithstanding, the <i>Cuckoo</i> died a natural
death.&nbsp; Contrary to general expectation, it &ldquo;dried
up,&rdquo; and was not &ldquo;smashed up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bat is not what naturalists would call a bird, but I feel
sure Davis thought it was.&nbsp; For his second venture was a
weekly publication called <i>The Bat</i>.&nbsp; In his earlier
paper he had gone out of his way to attack Society people; in the
<i>Bat</i> he found a savage delight in crucifying Stage
folk.&nbsp; In this direction he probably went as far as any man
ever <i>did</i> go without suffering from reprisals.&nbsp; He was
less fortunate when he turned his attention to the leading men on
the Turf.&nbsp; Lord Durham, being advised that the <i>Bat</i>
had gone beyond the limits of fair criticism, took criminal
proceedings.&nbsp; The redoubtable James, having a lawyer&rsquo;s
notion of what the upshot would be, and a nice appreciation of
the advantages of liberty, repaired to France, where he remained
in exile for several years.&nbsp; George Lewis, indeed, boasted
that as long as he (Lewis) lived Jimmy should never return to his
native land.&nbsp; And when two Jews feel like that about each
other, you may safely anticipate trouble.&nbsp; But Mrs. Davis
brought her personal influence to bear on Lord Durham, and, the
Hatton Garden threat notwithstanding, &ldquo;Jimmy,&rdquo; who
had got as far as Boulogne, was permitted to return to
London&mdash;absent from which centre of activity he was never
really happy.</p>
<p>Some few years before his death Davis founded yet another
paper.&nbsp; This time he combined in his title his taste both
for ornithology and for mythology.&nbsp; He called his paper <a
name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span><i>The
Ph&oelig;nix</i>.&nbsp; He now showed his pristine smartness
without his old-time scurrility.&nbsp; The paper was, indeed,
very well done&mdash;bright, original, and mordantly
humorous.&nbsp; But the day for that sort of thing was closing
in.&nbsp; There was no longer any public for six-pennyworth of
smartness.&nbsp; Seeing this, the accommodating proprietor
reduced his price to twopence; but even at that figure his
smartness proved unsaleable.&nbsp; At the other end of the town,
however, he was making money &ldquo;hand over fist,&rdquo; as the
vulgar saying has it.&nbsp; His &ldquo;Floradora&rdquo; was
running at a West End theatre and playing to crowded
houses.&nbsp; I suspect that a considerable amount of the money
which he made out of comic opera was lost in comic
journalism.&nbsp; I wrote for Davis on all his papers, and
although he usually owed me a balance at the moment of the
inevitable &ldquo;smash-up&rdquo; or &ldquo;dry-up,&rdquo; that
balance was so inconsiderable in each case, as compared with the
sums that I had taken from him, that I never thought of pressing
him.&nbsp; Davis was essentially a good &ldquo;pal.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He has followed his papers and his other enterprises into the
grave.&nbsp; May the turf lie light on him!&nbsp; The Turf
pressed him rather heavily here.</p>
<p>Another bird of ill omen was <i>The Hawk</i>.&nbsp; This was
hatched out by Augustus Moore, an Irishman very well known in the
eighties on the Press, but in later years better known in
connection with the stage and stage plays.&nbsp; Augustus Moore
was the brother of George of that ilk, an author who first came
into notice by means of a collection of verses, chiefly
imitations of Swinburne, and called &ldquo;Pagan Poems,&rdquo;
and afterwards notorious for some faithful studies of domestic
servants given to the public in the guise of fiction of the
Zolaesque order of literature.&nbsp; In his labours on the
<i>Hawk</i>, Augustus Moore was greatly assisted by his
compatriot and copartner, Mr. J. M. Glover, known in later days
as the conductor at Drury Lane and onetime Mayor of
Bexhill-on-Sea.</p>
<p>Moore passed through many vicissitudes in carrying on the
<i>Hawk</i>, all of them encountered in that spirit of cheery
optimism which characterized the adventurers of the jocund
days&mdash;the boys of the Old Brigade, as Clement Scott called
<a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>them.&nbsp; But the financial position at last became
impossible.&nbsp; Moore sold out his interest for a small sum,
and the <i>Hank</i> came under the control of John Chandor, an
implacable enemy of Moore&rsquo;s, and a sort of Ishmael in his
attitude with respect to society generally.&nbsp; Chandor&rsquo;s
reign was brief but lurid.&nbsp; He hit out all round, not with
the rapier, but with the bludgeon, and at last, getting into a
fracas at the Aquarium with some gentlemen holding commissions in
the army, he attacked these men by name in his paper.&nbsp; The
Colonel of the regiment insisted on his officers obtaining an
apology or bringing an action.&nbsp; No apology was
forthcoming.&nbsp; The action was taken; heavy damages were
imposed.&nbsp; The venomous bird of prey had made her last
flight.</p>
<p><i>The Pelican</i> may, at first sight, appear to be an
exception to the rule which associates ill luck with the
selection of a bird name for a paper.&nbsp; But, with all respect
to Mr. Boyd, the <i>Pelican</i> is scarcely a paper in any large
or liberal use of that term.&nbsp; It is a little organ owned,
edited, and principally written, by one man.&nbsp; It has
discovered a nice adjustment between the minimum of
&ldquo;copy&rdquo; and the maximum of advertisement.&nbsp; But
the circulation is good, and the advertisers are quite satisfied,
so no one else need cavil; however, I should not advise any
future promoter to attempt success on Mr. Boyd&rsquo;s lines,
even with a good bird name to start out on.</p>
<p>Another bird which, having for many years suffered severely
from the pip, at length died a lingering death, not greatly
regretted by the public for which it fatuously
&ldquo;clucked,&rdquo; was <i>The Bird o&rsquo;
Freedom</i>.&nbsp; This weird fowl was hatched in the hot
incubators of the <i>Sporting Times</i>.&nbsp; Its memorial
tablet is now affixed, together with that of the <i>Man of the
World</i>, among the titles of the parent paper.&nbsp; No paper
has so many titles incorporated as the <i>Pink Un</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much money should you have to start a daily
newspaper?&rdquo; I once asked the owner of one of our great
dailies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two hundred and fifty thousand pounds,&rdquo; he
answered promptly.</p>
<p><a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>Many
daily papers have been started on less than that sum, and a few
of them have succeeded.&nbsp; But my experience of Fleet Street
confirms the estimate of the eminent man whom I have
quoted.&nbsp; It is not the mere start, of course, that demands
that large capital sum; it is the income expended in keeping the
thing going until it reaches the paying point that renders
desirable a big capital.&nbsp; The best sub-edited paper that
ever saw the light in London was <i>The Echo</i>.&nbsp; Its
editing also was good.&nbsp; But for sub-editing it held, in its
time, an easy pre-eminence.&nbsp; No one knows&mdash;no one ever
will know&mdash;the amount of capital sunk in that venture
successively by the publishers in La Belle Sauvage Yard, by Baron
Grant, and by Passmore Edwards.&nbsp; Sanguine speculators
succeeded each other in prolonging its existence.&nbsp; It was
the very type and model of what an evening paper should be.&nbsp;
It lived for many years.&nbsp; It never paid.&nbsp; It is one of
the mysteries of the profession.</p>
<p>A much shorter shrift was accorded by the public&mdash;that
<i>difficile</i> and insensate public!&mdash;to <i>The
Hour</i>.&nbsp; This ambitious Tory organ was edited by Captain
Hamber, who had held a corresponding post on the
<i>Standard</i>.&nbsp; Hamber was one of the most remarkable men
I ever met.&nbsp; He possessed some rather pronounced
eccentricities; but he was a gentleman <i>ad unguem</i>, and he
had the authentic editorial <i>flair</i>.&nbsp; But the faith of
the proprietors of the <i>Hour</i> could not have been equal to
the proverbial grain of mustard-seed.&nbsp; For&mdash;at least,
so Hamber more than once told me&mdash;they &ldquo;shut
down&rdquo; on the very day on which, for the first time, the
paper showed a profit.&nbsp; On the collapse of this Conservative
venture the gallant Captain was offered the editorship of the
<i>Morning Advertiser</i>.&nbsp; Thus he could&mdash;and
did&mdash;boast of having controlled the destinies of three
morning papers.&nbsp; He did not, however, very greatly relish
his connection with the &ldquo;<i>&rsquo;Tiser</i>,&rdquo; as it
was irreverently called by the Street.&nbsp; But he did his work
well and conscientiously, and succeeded in what should have
seemed an impossible task&mdash;that, namely, of raising the tone
and increasing the influence and circulation of the organ of the
British Bung.</p>
<p>Hamber always treated his licensed victualling proprietors <a
name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>with a sort
of lordly tolerance, and they forgave his mood in return for the
good fortune which had attended his conduct of their
property.&nbsp; Indeed, they evinced the unbounded confidence
they bestowed in him by always granting any advances for which he
asked, for he was afflicted with a chronic need of
advances.&nbsp; Once or twice the worthy men gave him a bonus to
discharge some pressing obligations.&nbsp; His salary was
&pound;1,000 a year; but had it been &pound;5,000 a year, Hamber
would have contrived to get through it.&nbsp; To be in debt was
his <i>m&eacute;tier</i>.&nbsp; Yet he was fond of lecturing
members of the staff, who evinced a faculty for following his
brilliant example on the folly and wickedness of the thing.&nbsp;
Indeed, I have known him to be interrupted in the delivery of a
homily of the kind by the intrusion of a Sheriff&rsquo;s officer
charged with an ultimatum to the genial editor himself.</p>
<p>His handwriting was the very worst I ever attempted to make
out.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, he could not decipher it
himself.&nbsp; But there was one compositor in each of the
offices in which he had edited who could set up his copy, though,
as Hamber often said, &ldquo;whether he really sets up exactly
what I wrote is quite another matter.&nbsp; But he always swears
he does, and I&rsquo;m blessed if I can contradict
him!&rdquo;&nbsp; Before Captain Hamber took to journalism he had
become known as having been the man who enrolled and commanded
the German Legion during the Crimean War.&nbsp; Neither Hamber
nor his Legion was ever called to the front; but it was generally
admitted that in this matter he had acted promptly and
patriotically.&nbsp; Hamber was a staunch party man, a member of
the Junior Carlton Club from its foundation, and he possessed an
unrivalled acquaintance with the fine art of party tactics.&nbsp;
It is not altogether to the credit of the party that his last
days should have been passed under a cloud to which there was no
silver lining.&nbsp; He was a man physically of great
proportions, but had acquired a stooping habit and unmilitary
gait.&nbsp; And his great frame contained a heart as big as the
shell that enshrined it.</p>
<p>The forerunner of the halfpenny dailies was <i>The
Morning</i>.&nbsp; The one circumstance against that wonderfully
well edited <a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
199</span>paper was that it came before its time.&nbsp; It was
founded by Mr. Chester Ives, one of the most popular and most
accomplished of the American colony in London.&nbsp; He edited
the paper himself, and surrounded himself with a really smart and
reliable staff.&nbsp; Among other men whom he introduced was a
young man from the North who afterwards became associated with
the Harmsworths in the promotion of their successful newspaper
undertakings.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the bold bid which the
<i>Morning</i> made for public favour, it failed to &ldquo;catch
on,&rdquo; and we watched its disappearance with regret&mdash;but
not as those without hope.&nbsp; Poor Chester Ives! since the
above lines were penned he has passed from amongst us, and under
peculiarly painful circumstances.</p>
<p>H. J. Byron brought out a penny rival to <i>Punch</i>, to
which he gave the somewhat jejune title <i>Comic News</i>.&nbsp;
But there was nothing at all jejune about the contents.&nbsp; The
editor seemed to have inspired his staff with his own spirit of
wild and irresponsible fun.&nbsp; The thing was a roar from
beginning to end.&nbsp; The title displayed a caricature of the
royal arms, with the mottoes &ldquo;Dieu et mon droit&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Honi soit qui mal y pense&rdquo; riotously rendered,
&ldquo;Do &rsquo;em and drwaw it&rdquo; and &ldquo;On his walks
he madly puns.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was the funniest thing ever
produced, but it did not take with the many-headed.&nbsp; I
strongly suspect that the public imagined that &ldquo;H.
J.&rdquo; was laughing <i>at</i> and not <i>with</i> them.</p>
<p>Two weekly organs of gossip, criticism, and politics which
depended for acceptance chiefly on their cartoons were the
<i>Tomahawk</i> and <i>Will O&rsquo; the Wisp</i>.&nbsp; The
former introduced to the public the bold and effective artistic
work of Matt Morgan; the latter was the first to discover the
abundant merits of the art of my friend John Proctor.&nbsp; In
the literary department both papers occasionally condescended to
scandal and scurrility.&nbsp; Morgan&rsquo;s cartoon entitled
&ldquo;A Brown Study&rdquo; was resented by all decent-minded
men, and both papers failed because they entirely misunderstood
the tastes of those who at that time purchased weekly
journals.&nbsp; The cartoons in both cases were of sufficient
merit to keep any properly edited paper alive.&nbsp; But when the
cartoonists <a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
200</span>themselves were inspired by the conductors the worst
happened.&nbsp; Both papers died the death unregretted.</p>
<p>How the <i>St. Stephen&rsquo;s Review</i> managed to struggle
through its recurring financial viscissitudes is one of the
unsolved mysteries of the publishing world.&nbsp; It was a strong
Tory weekly, price sixpence, with a coloured cartoon by Tom
Merry, and the one outstanding fact to its credit is that Mr.
William Alison, the editor, gave Phil May his first chance.&nbsp;
Alison has since those days discovered his journalistic
<i>m&eacute;tier</i> in a field far removed from the arid area of
politics, and in his new line he has achieved a large and
financial success.&nbsp; I wrote a lot of copy for the <i>St.
Stephen&rsquo;s Review</i>.&nbsp; But I turned it up after a
while, and I have no doubt someone better qualified took my
place.</p>
<p>A curious incident happened to me in connection with this
paper.&nbsp; The Hon. Mrs. Whyte-Melville, widow of the novelist,
had engaged as her private chaplain a wild Irish divine known as
the Rev. Peter Higginson.&nbsp; Peter had been chaplain to Bishop
Colenso, and his native impetuosity had been increased on the
African veldt.&nbsp; Now, a paragraph had appeared in
Alison&rsquo;s paper in which it was stated, as a matter of
gossip, that Whyte-Melville&rsquo;s favourite cob, which had been
provided an old age of ease by the deceased gentleman&rsquo;s
will, was being daily galloped about the Thames Valley by a mad
clergyman with a big red beard.&nbsp; A day or two after the
appearance of the paragraph a gentleman answering the description
of the person mentioned in connection with Whyte-Melville&rsquo;s
cob, entered my room unannounced.&nbsp; He threw a copy of the
paper containing the note on the table at which I was
sitting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That manes me, an&rsquo; you wrote it!&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>I asked him to be so good as to remove his hat and take a
seat.&nbsp; He complied growling, and blushing, I thought, on his
cheek-bones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, perhaps,&rdquo; I suggested suavely, &ldquo;you
will tell me who you are and how you got in here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the Rivirind Pether Higginson,&rdquo; he
answered, in a more chastened spirit, &ldquo;an&rsquo; I gev your
boy five shilluns to let me in.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>I
rang the bell.&nbsp; My unfortunate clerk entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got five shillings belonging to this
gentleman.&nbsp; Give them back to him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Greatly
resenting the order, the boy complied.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now show the
gentleman out!&rdquo; I continued.</p>
<p>A letter from Peter received a month after assured me that he
had discovered the writer of the offensive note, that he greatly
regretted his intrusion, and that he would esteem it as a great
favour if I would lunch with him on the following day at
Simpson&rsquo;s in the Strand.&nbsp; I went, and had a most
amusing time listening to his gasconading.&nbsp; He married the
widow for the repose of whose husband&rsquo;s soul he had been
engaged to pray, and I became an occasional visitor at their
house at St. Margaret&rsquo;s-on-Thames.&nbsp; Peter&rsquo;s
solicitude for my welfare was quaintly evinced on the first
occasion of my dining with the newly-married couple.&nbsp; Just
before going into the dining-room he whispered solemnly in my
ear:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t dhrink the clar&rsquo;t: it&rsquo;s
muck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I be waspish best beware!&rdquo; was the motto which
appeared under the title of <i>The Hornet</i>.&nbsp; This smart
and satirical little paper was originally launched in the wilds
of Hornsey as a minor City organ.&nbsp; It then came into the
hands of the American, Stephen Fiske.&nbsp; This gentleman made
theatrical criticism the leading feature of his newly-acquired
property.&nbsp; He was a great friend of Mrs. John Wood, the
inimitable comedienne, and he was said to have been financed by
Peabody the philanthropist.&nbsp; This I always took leave to
doubt, because, although Fiske put plenty of brains and labour
into his new purchase, it gave none of the customary signs of any
considerable outlay of money.&nbsp; Indeed, in his hands, the
<i>Hornet</i> was more or less (rather more than less) of a
financial failure.&nbsp; Fiske returned to New York.&nbsp; Here
he took up the post of dramatic critic on the <i>Spirit of the
Times</i>, a position which he still holds, though the name of
the journal has been changed to <i>Sports of the Times</i>.</p>
<p>Joseph Hatton then undertook to run the <i>Hornet</i>.&nbsp;
Hatton had written a novel called &ldquo;Clytie,&rdquo; a great
part of which was made up of the proceedings in the celebrated
Twiss case <a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
202</span>lifted bodily from the columns of a daily paper.&nbsp;
The novel enjoyed a sort of library success, and Hatton thought
to increase the circulation of his new property by bringing out
&ldquo;Clytie&rdquo; as a serial.&nbsp; Now, the public hates
reprint, and it particularly hates reprint of unsuccessful
stuff.&nbsp; But Hatton was obsessed by
&ldquo;Clytie.&rdquo;&nbsp; He not only ran it in his paper, but
he turned it into a play, and as he could not find a manager
willing to produce it, he took it on the road himself.&nbsp; That
soon settled poor Jo Hatton, and incidentally involved his
parting with the <i>Hornet</i>.</p>
<p>Under the editorship of Vero Shaw the <i>Hornet</i> exhibited
all the signs of enlightened management and a desire to live up
to the paper&rsquo;s motto.&nbsp; Shaw introduced new men and new
features.&nbsp; H. J. Byron was engaged to write a serial, and he
also contributed a weekly causerie entitled &ldquo;Our Absurd
Column.&rdquo;&nbsp; Other members of the staff were Godfrey
Turner, John Augustus O&rsquo;Shea, Tom Purnell, and the
redoubtable Featherstonhaugh.&nbsp; For the first time in its
varied career the paper began to hum, a circumstance attributable
not only to the increased brightness of the literary department,
but also to the fact that the cartoons were the work of that most
gifted of caricaturists and most amiable of men, the late Alfred
Bryan.&nbsp; One salient feature of the paper under its new
control was a spicy City article in which the bucket-shops of the
period were remorselessly exposed and condemned.&nbsp; A
syndicate of City men then came forward and offered a price so
substantial that the proprietor could not resist the temptation
to realize.&nbsp; Having gained their object by purchase, the
<i>Hornet</i> was put to a speedy and painless end by its new
owners.</p>
<p>An incident delightfully characteristic of the irresponsible
way in which minor journalism was carried on in the jocund days
may be popped in here.&nbsp; I can personally vouch for the truth
of it.&nbsp; During the last weeks of his proprietorship, and
during the negotiations for sale, Hatton was away from home, and
the affairs of the <i>Hornet</i> were left in the hands of
Broughton, the dramatic critic.&nbsp; It was essential, in view
of negotiations then pending, that the paper should be kept
alive.&nbsp; Danks, the printer, whose &ldquo;works&rdquo; were
next door <a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
203</span>to the Argyll Rooms, suddenly refused to proceed with
the printing unless his balance were paid, and the &ldquo;oof
bird&rdquo; was particularly shy and strong on the wing just
then.&nbsp; Broughton, though a little man, was a most loyal and
determined one.&nbsp; By hypothecating some sleeve-links and a
watch-chain, and by the skilful man&oelig;uvring of cross
cheques, a small sum of &ldquo;ready&rdquo; was secured.&nbsp;
The Cesarewitch was being run that day, and the money thus
secured was, on the advice of Vero Shaw, invested on
Hilarious.&nbsp; The noble horse won at excellent odds.&nbsp;
Danks, the printer, was appeased, the hypothecated jewellery was
redeemed, the cross cheques met, and the <i>Hornet</i> saved!</p>
<p>James Mortimer made a long, arduous, and plucky fight of it
with <i>Figaro</i>.&nbsp; First of all the paper appeared as a
daily, and was supposed to enjoy some financial backing from the
Tuileries.&nbsp; Eventually it settled down into a weekly.&nbsp;
For a short period, too, it sent out a Sunday edition.&nbsp; But
Mortimer was not one of the lucky ones.&nbsp; After the
disappearance of <i>Figaro</i> from the face of the earth, he
started the <i>Lantern</i>, and in still more recent years the
<i>Anglo-Saxon</i>.&nbsp; His later bantlings all perished in
early life owing to feeble circulation and insufficient
nourishment.&nbsp; It is, however, with his first venture,
<i>Figaro</i>, that the name of James Mortimer will always remain
honourably associated.&nbsp; His staff on that paper was largely
recruited from the Civil Service.&nbsp; He engaged Clement Scott,
of the War Office; Dowty (&ldquo; O. P. Q. Philander
Smiff&rdquo;), of the Paymaster&rsquo;s Office; Ernest Bendall,
of the same Department; Archer and Winterbotham.&nbsp; They were
not only capable writers&mdash;Mortimer was wont to say&mdash;but
they were reliable.&nbsp; &ldquo;You always know where to find
them when you want them,&rdquo; he would slyly add.&nbsp;
Mortimer&rsquo;s hobby had always been chess, and to the pursuit
of this stimulating science he devoted a considerable portion of
a full and busy life.</p>
<p>Hugo Ames was, I think, the tallest man who ever adventured in
Fleet Street.&nbsp; He is a younger brother of Captain
&ldquo;Ossy&rdquo; Ames, who has the distinction of being the
tallest man in the British Army.&nbsp; The career of Mr. Ames as
a newspaper proprietor was brief&mdash;and disastrous.&nbsp; He
established <a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>a smart little paper called <i>The Dwarf</i>, to which
he contributed largely himself.&nbsp; He also founded <i>Smart
Society</i>, and he was foolishly persuaded to purchase the
<i>Hawk</i>.&nbsp; Ames was a splendid fellow, but he got into
wrong hands, and as a consequence dropped a fortune at newspaper
promotion in less than two years.</p>
<p>. . . But I have exceeded the chapter limit which I had
assigned to myself, and I have dealt with but a few of the
dear&mdash;the very dear&mdash;departed papers of my day. . .
.&nbsp; The sheeted dead press round me, gibbering and clamouring
for notice.&nbsp; Poor ineffectual ghosts!&nbsp; They are doomed
still to &ldquo;walk.&rdquo;&nbsp; I have no space in which to
&ldquo;lay&rdquo; them.</p>

205</span>CHAPTER XIV<br />
<span class="GutSmall">MY FRIENDS THE PLAYERS</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Nearly</span> opposite the old Gaiety
Theatre in the Strand stood the offices of Gaze and Co., the
tourists&rsquo; agents.&nbsp; And in the early seventies the
upper part of the premises had been let to a retired old sea-dog
of portly person and convivial habits called Captain
Harris.&nbsp; This gentleman had made a somewhat extensive
acquaintance among the lesser lights of the stage, the
music-hall, and the newspaper world, and he had taken the upper
part of the Gaze office with the view of turning it into a
Bohemian club.</p>
<p>For a while the institution flourished greatly.&nbsp; It was
named the Savoy Club&mdash;on the <i>lucus a non lucendo</i>
principle&mdash;and by those who had not been chosen for
membership it was nicknamed &ldquo;the Saveloy.&rdquo;&nbsp; A
continuous conviviality was the dominant note of the
establishment.&nbsp; The hours kept by the members were
astounding.&nbsp; The pace, in a word, was too fast.&nbsp; And in
a couple of years the Savoy closed its doors, the unfortunate
mariner who founded it having lost in the venture the savings of
a lifetime.</p>
<p>It was at the Savoy that I first met John Hollingshead.&nbsp;
After the closing of his theatre he would drop in of a night,
generally accompanied by one or two members of the Gaiety
company.&nbsp; No man ever undertook the management of a
playhouse with less practical knowledge of the stage than
Hollingshead; no man ever conducted a theatre more successfully,
and to no man is the public more indebted for the amelioration of
the condition of that portion of it which patronizes the
drama.&nbsp; Hollingshead was a man of sound common-sense, never
hide-bound by tradition, and <a name="page206"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 206</span>always possessing the courage of his
opinions.&nbsp; These were the characteristics which he brought
to bear on the unknown enterprise of theatrical management.&nbsp;
And so considerable was the success attending the application of
his principles to the unfamiliar task which he had undertaken,
that in the course of a few years he became known all over
&ldquo;the profession&rdquo; by the sobriquet of &ldquo;Practical
John.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is true that after a successful managerial career lasting
over many years his luck deserted him, and his theatre fell into
other hands, but the period of undimmed success during which he
kept burning that which he called &ldquo;the sacred lamp of
burlesque&rdquo; was one upon which he might look back with
considerable satisfaction.&nbsp; He was in many directions a
reformer.&nbsp; He abolished the programme fee.&nbsp; He refused
to sublet his cloak-rooms to the harpies who at that time held an
undisputed monopoly for at once incommoding and fleecing the
playgoers who booked for the stalls and boxes.&nbsp; He was the
first man in London who installed the electric light.&nbsp; He
did not, indeed, use it as an illuminant inside his
theatre&mdash;electric lighting was in its infancy, and had not
as yet been tried as an indoor illuminant&mdash;but he burned a
fierce, if blinking, electric globe over the main entrance to the
Gaiety, and he should have the obituary honours due to the
pioneer.</p>
<p>Gradually I became on intimate terms with Hollingshead, and
remained a friend of his until his lamented death.&nbsp; Some
millions&mdash;I am speaking by the card&mdash;had passed through
his hands to actors, authors, musicians, and the rest of the vast
army required to carry on the business of a successful
theatre.&nbsp; Yet he died in somewhat straitened
circumstances.&nbsp; His courage and his equable temper, however,
did not desert him.&nbsp; He was a bit of a fatalist, I
fancy.&nbsp; He spoke jauntily of being &ldquo;equal to either
fortune.&rdquo;&nbsp; Originally he had been on the Press.&nbsp;
He was one of the staff of Charles Dickens on <i>Household
Words</i> and <i>All the Year Round</i>.&nbsp; He wrote for
Thackeray on the <i>Cornhill</i>, and for Norman Macleod on
<i>Good Words</i>.&nbsp; Indeed, in the sixties his work was in
general demand by the magazine editors.&nbsp; The daily paper
with which he was most intimately associated was the <a
name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span><i>Daily
News</i>, for which his particular friend Moy Thomas was dramatic
critic.&nbsp; When he severed his connection with journalism, he
characteristically observed that a journalist is like a
barrel-organ&mdash;wound up to play so many tunes, and that when
he has &ldquo;run down&rdquo; it is time for him to retire.&nbsp;
Which, I may parenthetically mention, would have been a sad
doctrine for some of us.</p>
<p>No figure was more familiar in the Strand, Garrick Street, and
the West End than that of Hollingshead in the halcyon days of the
Gaiety.&nbsp; His good looks, his neat attire, his silvery hair,
his hat cocked a trifle on one side, his brisk walk, his cheery
expression, and his generally debonair appearance, suggested even
to the outsider the busy, competent, yet good-natured, man of
affairs.&nbsp; He was an excellent talker, very fond of
paradox.&nbsp; A utilitarian philosopher, he was a follower of
Jeremy Bentham.&nbsp; It was difficult to gather from his views
as given in conversation what his political convictions really
were.&nbsp; I once asked him the question.&nbsp; He readily
replied in that curious but modulated falsetto of his.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Tory Socialist,&rdquo; was his answer.</p>
<p>The stalls of the Gaiety&mdash;more particularly the front row
of the stalls&mdash;were filled with the <i>jeunesse
dor&eacute;e</i> of the period.&nbsp; These young gentlemen were
each interested in the career of one of the shapely vestals who
tended Hollingshead&rsquo;s &ldquo;sacred lamp.&rdquo;&nbsp; A
somewhat lavish display of figure was then <i>de rigueur</i> with
the chorus ladies.&nbsp; It had not yet become the fashion for
young men to marry into the chorus&mdash;so to say; but the young
swells made other arrangements which&mdash;in those
days&mdash;the chorus lady regarded as eminently
satisfactory.&nbsp; So the fortunes of the chorus ebbed and
flowed.&nbsp; I have called at the ineligible rooms of a chorus
lady while she was lunching on fried liver and bacon; her hair
was in curling-pins, and her principal article of attire was a
far from cleanly peignoir.&nbsp; She has called me by endearing
terms, and there was nothing in the world she would not surrender
to me in return for a newspaper notice a line long.&nbsp; In a
week&rsquo;s time I have seen the same young woman drive up to
the Gaiety in her own victoria, loaded with <a
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>jewels,
dressed in a Parisian inspiration, and with a crop of golden hair
which spoke volumes for the prolific nature of the foreign soil
in which it grew.&nbsp; Her attitude toward myself had changed as
perceptibly as had her coiffure, &ldquo;Hello, old
chappie!&rdquo; she has cried, with an amusing affectation of
high-bred hauteur.</p>
<p>The swagger stallites who had organized themselves into a
beauty cult at the Gaiety displayed every variety of what
Tennyson called &ldquo;the gilded forehead of the
fool.&rdquo;&nbsp; These young gentlemen were known as
&ldquo;mashers&rdquo; (the object of their temporary devotions
was known as a &ldquo;mash&rdquo;); as &ldquo;Johnnies&rdquo; and
as &ldquo;members of the Crutch and Toothpick
Brigade.&rdquo;&nbsp; In this race for the overrated favours of
the chorus lady they were often beaten by the elderly
&ldquo;masher&rdquo;&mdash;the fatuous old <i>rou&eacute;</i> of
the wig, the stays, the pigments, and the unguents.&nbsp; In
these, as in all other civil contracts, it is money that matters,
after all.</p>
<p>If Hollingshead played burlesque as his trump card, it must be
recalled, in justice to his memory, that he instituted the
matin&eacute;e in London; and that he instituted it, not as the
vehicle for amateur authors who played with problems, and called
the result &ldquo;problem plays,&rdquo; but as the means of
introducing to the London public (or re-introducing) the greatest
living exponents of the highest examples of dramatic
literature.&nbsp; He brought over from Paris the entire company
of the House of Moli&egrave;re.&nbsp; He engaged Charles Mathews
to play in a series of his memorable and delightful
performances.&nbsp; And if I don&rsquo;t mistake, he gave that
veteran actor the opportunity of enacting a new part in a
new-play, &ldquo;My Awful Dad.&rdquo;&nbsp; He afforded us the
opportunity of seeing Phelps in his rendering of Sir Pertinax
MacSycophant in Macklin&rsquo;s &ldquo;Man of the World,&rdquo;
probably the finest all-round bit of acting I have even been
privileged to witness.</p>
<p>Knowing &ldquo;Practical John,&rdquo; I soon came to know the
members of his company, the bright, particular star of which was
Miss Nellie Farren.&nbsp; Miss Farren was the embodiment of the
very spirit of burlesque.&nbsp; She was fun personified.&nbsp;
And although she had the support always <a
name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>of a
distinguished company&mdash;it included such men as Toole, Edward
Terry, Royce, and John MacLean, and such women as Constance
Loseby and Kate Vaughan&mdash;the whole weight of the production
seemed to fall on Nellie Farren&rsquo;s shoulders, and she lifted
it how, and where, and when she pleased.&nbsp; Off the stage Miss
Farren was quite as amusing as on.&nbsp; She had the rare gift of
spontaneous humour, a fine flow of animal spirits, an unfailing
good temper, the whole shot through with a certain indefinable
Cockney quality which gave to everything she said its
hall-mark.&nbsp; I do not think I ever spent more enjoyable
afternoons than on those Sundays when Miss Farren was at home to
her friends at Sunbury.&nbsp; She had bought two cottages near
the gates of Kempton Park, and had them knocked into one.&nbsp;
And here, on Sundays, the merry little <i>ch&acirc;telaine</i>
received her friends.&nbsp; And some very jovial gatherings we
had on those Sunbury sabbaths.&nbsp; The outstanding
characteristic of the average actress when off the stage is an
obvious artificiality.&nbsp; The charm of the Farren&rsquo;s
society was in her frank naturalness, her ingenuous honesty.</p>
<p>Nellie Farren was the wife of Robert Soutar, the stage-manager
of the Gaiety, a comic actor of limited range, and the author of
some popular farces.&nbsp; An extremely convivial soul when off
the stage, he was regarded as a martinet while on it, and during
the entire period of his stage-management hardly a day passed
without a rehearsal being called on some pretence or
another.&nbsp; For this reason he was highly disapproved of by
the chorus, toward the members of which his sentiments were
sometimes conveyed with brutal directness.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only sort of language they
understand,&rdquo; he once said to me.&nbsp; Perhaps he was
right, although the polished shafts of Byron&rsquo;s irony often
went home quite as surely.&nbsp; I have known a girl at rehearsal
burst into tears under the suavely-spoken sarcasm of Byron, and I
once received a letter of complaint from a member of a chorus
illustrating one of his burlesques, in which the talented author
of &ldquo;Our Boys&rdquo; was described as &ldquo;a nasty,
sneerin&rsquo; beest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The inauguration of the old Gaiety and the passing of it,
roughly speaking, cover the period of my own experience <a
name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span>of the
London stage and its interesting entourage, which must be my
excuse for according to my memories of the Gaiety what may seem
to be an undue space.</p>
<p>If anyone were to ask me who, in my experience, was the most
mirth-provoking actor I had ever seen, I should, without the
least hesitation, mention a name which is quite unknown to the
playgoers of this generation, and is being rapidly forgotten by
those who belong to the last.&nbsp; And the name that I should
mention would be that of John Sleeper Clarke.&nbsp; The house at
which he originally appeared was the little Strand Theatre,
merrily associated with the burlesques of the Broughs and Byron,
and subsequently with the less artless productions of H. B.
Farnie, in which so much laughter was made for the public by
Marius and Edward Terry, and that plump, inimitable Angelina
Claude.&nbsp; J. S. Clarke was an American, and, although he
appeared with great success in some of our dramatic
masterpieces&mdash;he was the finest Bob Acres and the best Dr.
Pangloss of his day&mdash;he preferred to enact characters
written for him in pieces of which he held the copyright.</p>
<p>Clarke&rsquo;s favourite characters were Major Wellington De
Boots and Toodles.&nbsp; It is always a hopeless task to attempt
to convey to those who have not witnessed it the effect of a
comic performance on the observer.&nbsp; It would not be correct
to describe Clarke as an &ldquo;eccentric&rdquo; actor.&nbsp; His
thoroughly artistic and masterly impersonation of Bob Acres and
Dr. Pangloss quite forbid any hasty generalization of the
kind.&nbsp; It would be more just to say that he selected
eccentric characters for representation, and in the illustration
of these characters he employed for all they were worth certain
quaint methods of voice, expression, gesture, and gait which were
quite his own.&nbsp; The pieces in which he introduced himself as
an irresponsible eccentric were as a rule flimsy compositions,
entirely negligible from a literary and dramatic point of
view.&nbsp; But in the mouth of Clarke the inanities of the
dramatist became precious gems.&nbsp; He would utter an
author&rsquo;s commonplace with such an air of comic
gravity&mdash;if I may use the expression&mdash;with such an
inimitable facial note of enjoyment in the delivery, that the <a
name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>little
house in the Strand would rock with laughter over sayings which
in cold print would appear to be the veriest drivel.</p>
<p>There must be many men about town who retain a vivid
recollection of Clarke&rsquo;s acting.&nbsp; They will bear me
out as to the statement just made.&nbsp; They will remember how
their sides shook as Clarke in &ldquo;De Boots&rdquo; made the
entirely empty declaration: &ldquo;My dear Felix, I call you
Felix because you are my best friend!&rdquo;&nbsp; What an
extraordinary quality of irresistible humour he imparted to that
absurdly puerile line!&nbsp; Again, what a weight and world of
dramatic humour he imposed on the trifling sentence addressed to
the pump in &ldquo;Toodles&rdquo;!&nbsp; The scene is one in
which he depicts a man imperfectly sober.&nbsp; Stumbling about a
yard, he knocks against the pump.&nbsp; He grasps the handle,
snakes it heartily up and down, exclaiming the while,
&ldquo;Excuse me, my friend&mdash;er&mdash;will you take
anything?&rdquo; Banal to a degree, I quite admit.&nbsp; But
Lord! how often have I roared over the words, and to how many of
my own day who read this page do they not recall an ineffaceable
and delightful recollection&mdash;an they would but acknowledge
it.</p>
<p>I hate to apply the money test as a standard by which to
measure the value of artistic work.&nbsp; In many instances it is
no test at all.&nbsp; The artistic charlatan sometimes amasses a
fortune.&nbsp; But this does not hold so literally with the actor
who has to appeal in person to patrons drawn from all classes of
society.&nbsp; In his case the making of a fortune must surely be
a reliable test of the possession of the real sort of
genius.&nbsp; Clarke in a very few years in London made a
fortune, purchased the lease of the Haymarket, and retired from
his profession into private life without any formal
leave-taking.&nbsp; Years after I first roared over his
impersonations, I was introduced to him in a little hotel in one
of the streets&mdash;Surrey Street, or another&mdash;close to the
old Strand Theatre.&nbsp; Here the merry-maker was in the habit
of sitting alone.&nbsp; He was the most moody, melancholy, shy,
and reticent person with whom I had up to that time become
acquainted.&nbsp; There was no slightest trace of the
spontaneous, irrepressible, and irresistible fun which <a
name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 212</span>seemed to
possess him when he made his welcome entrances on the
stage.&nbsp; I met him many times afterwards.&nbsp; I made a
point of meeting him.&nbsp; The desire to understand the problem
presented obsessed me.&nbsp; But I found him always the
same&mdash;polite in a grave way, willing to converse to the
extent of answering a question or passing a shy opinion when it
was challenged.&nbsp; But he made no jokes, told no anecdotes,
indulged in no reminiscence.&nbsp; Others who knew him told me
the same tale of him.&nbsp; In the roaring Strand John Sleeper
Clarke was as much a recluse as though he lived in a hut in the
depths of a forest.</p>
<p>Reticence is not usually the characteristic note of the
actor.&nbsp; Of all the companionships that I formed during my
Press experiences, none were so enjoyable as those I made on the
stage.&nbsp; There are, of course, some pompous asses among
them.&nbsp; But you will find these in all callings.&nbsp; And
the pompous mummer was never the most successful one.&nbsp; As a
rule, the more distinguished and gifted the actor, the more
genial and accessible he is.&nbsp; The players are full of
amusing early experiences, which they relate with delightful
candour.&nbsp; Actors&rsquo; stories are, as a rule, well told,
and are worth telling.&nbsp; Nor is this extraordinary.&nbsp;
Making points off the stage should be very good practice for
making points on it.&nbsp; There were two classes of raconteur in
my day.&nbsp; The one was the reminiscent or quasi-historical
man; the other was the simple retailer of good stories.&nbsp; Of
the former class the two finest examples were John Ryder and John
Coleman.&nbsp; Of the latter were Lionel Brough and Arthur
Williams.&nbsp; I should not have used the past tense in alluding
to Arthur Williams, who, I am happy to know, is alive and well,
and still entertaining a public in whose smiles he has basked for
many years.</p>
<p>My first introduction to Lionel
Brough&mdash;&ldquo;Lal,&rdquo; as he was always affectionately
called&mdash;was at Covent Garden, where he was stage-manager
during the career of that costly experiment &ldquo;Babil and
Bijou.&rdquo;&nbsp; The late Lord Londesborough was a determined
supporter of the stage, a great friend of actors&mdash;and
actresses&mdash;and a generous contributor to theatrical
charities.&nbsp; His lordship financed the Covent Garden Opera <a
name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>House when
it was taken by Miss Fowler.&nbsp; Boucicault did the
play&mdash;a sort of pantomime, we should call it
to-day&mdash;with processions, and ballets, and comic relief, and
popular songs, and all the rest of it.&nbsp; There was an army of
Amazons, headed by the statuesque Helen Barry, who had started
her artistic career in a cigar-shop in Piccadilly.&nbsp; The
armour of these ladies cost no end of money, being very beautiful
and substantial.&nbsp; A few weeks since I met a manager&mdash;a
provincial manager&mdash;in the North who informed me that some
of the properties and armour made for &ldquo;Babil and
Bijou&rdquo; were being taken round the country by fifth-rate
travelling companies to this day.</p>
<p>But to get back to &ldquo;Lal&rdquo; and his stories.&nbsp;
The majority of these were, I have every reason to believe,
&ldquo;made up&rdquo; by Brough.&nbsp; Everything was in the
telling.&nbsp; One of them occurs to me now.&nbsp; A certain
young married couple had been rendered very unhappy by the
betting habits of the husband.&nbsp; They had an only boy of some
seven summers.&nbsp; They were in debt all over the place.&nbsp;
The servant had been discharged.&nbsp; There was little food in
the house.&nbsp; At this tragic juncture a cheque for forty
pounds arrived.&nbsp; The relieved and delighted husband embraced
his wife and hurried off to the city to &ldquo;melt&rdquo; the
cheque, promising to return immediately, settle all outstanding
accounts, and take the family out to dinner.&nbsp; There was
racing at Kempton that day, and the unfortunate man knew of one
or two &ldquo;certs.&rdquo;&nbsp; So when he had received the
proceeds of the cheque, he ran down to Kempton Park, fired with
the benevolent idea of doubling, or even quadrupling, his forty
pounds.&nbsp; The usual thing happened.&nbsp; Far from winning,
he dropped every sou, and returned home a sad, despairing
man.&nbsp; He hoped for sympathy from his wife; but, for the
first time in their married existence, the wife rose to the
occasion, and, in unmistakable terms, denounced her stricken and
shamefaced spouse.&nbsp; He slunk from the room, and silently
closed the door behind him.&nbsp; She heard him mount the
stairs.&nbsp; But her heart was hardened against him.&nbsp; Ten
minutes after the exit of the gambler her little golden-haired
blue-eyed boy dashed into the room.</p>
<p><a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
214</span>&ldquo;Oh, mummy!&rdquo; he cried, in his eager, happy
way, &ldquo;daddy&rsquo;s cut hisself shavin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H-h-h-has he cut himself much?&rdquo; asked the woman,
rising.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut hisself much!&rdquo; exclaimed the innocent child;
&ldquo;he&rsquo;s cut his bally head off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brough used to tell another story in which the same note of
exaggeration was the salient characteristic.&nbsp; It had to do
with a Scotsman and a kilt, and afforded a sort of current phrase
in his clubs for a time.&nbsp; The quoted phrase was:
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a maun o&rsquo; few wor-r-r-ds!&rdquo;&nbsp; The
story is not of the kind that can easily be conveyed in cold
print.</p>
<p>Some years before his death I went into the Eccentric Club
with him.&nbsp; There had been a considerable making of
theatrical knights at or about the time; and when we entered the
club-room, we found a smart young journalist of the new school
inveighing against the knighting of stage folk.&nbsp; Brough, who
did not care a red cent one way or the other, but who felt
himself bound to stick up for his order, asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why should not actors be made knights?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; answered the adolescent Fleet Streeter,
with professional glibness, &ldquo;they belong to a wandering, a
nomadic, race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sort of Arabian knights, I suppose,&rdquo; suggested
Brough, closing the discussion with the acquiescent ridicule that
kills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lal&rdquo; Brough and John L. Toole were the especial
favourites of Londesborough among the players, and they might
frequently be seen on his drag&mdash;his lordship was an
accomplished &ldquo;whip&rdquo;&mdash;driving down to
race-meetings near London, or enjoying in his company the
beauties of Scarborough.</p>
<p>Another indomitable patron of the stage in the seventies and
eighties was the Duke of Beaufort.&nbsp; His Grace was
particularly quick in discovering budding talent in pretty
actresses.&nbsp; To his fostering care was due the great advance
which Miss Connie Gilchrist made in an education outside the
meagre accomplishments demanded in an actress of <a
name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
215</span>burlesque&mdash;an education which fitted her for
taking that high place in Society which she was destined to
fill.&nbsp; Ah, dear me! it seems but a little while ago since
the Duke was giving those luncheons in the upper room at
Rule&rsquo;s in Maiden Lane, at which the time passed for all of
us so quickly and so gaily.&nbsp; Yet how few of those who sat at
the board have survived to tell the tale!</p>
<p>In a public-house kept by one Beck in that part of the Strand
which backed on to Holywell Street, and has disappeared under the
advance of the County Council improvements, there was established
a small club of actors and journalists, called the Unity
Club.&nbsp; This was a coterie to which admission was not quite
so easy as its surroundings might suggest.&nbsp; The talk there
was excellent because, I think, there were always a sufficient
number of butts upon which to exercise the ingenuity of the
wits.&nbsp; It was in this select assembly that George R. Sims
was first enabled to give a taste of his quality.&nbsp; His
butt-in-ordinary was a very boastful actor named Harcourt, and
the verses&mdash;chiefly in parody of great poets&mdash;which
Sims wrote on one of Harcourt&rsquo;s big boasts will still be
recalled by those who were privileged to read one of the few
copies printed.&nbsp; The &ldquo;house-dinner&rdquo; at the Unity
Club was one of the most enjoyable feasts to which I ever sat
down.&nbsp; The fare, indeed, was plain and substantial, but the
sauce provided by the cheery players and pressmen who sat round
the table was the most piquant to be obtained in all London.</p>
<p>At the Unity might sometimes be met David James and Tom
Thorne, of the Strand Theatre.&nbsp; The club was just opposite
to the theatre.&nbsp; When James and Thorne left the Strand, and,
in partnership with Harry Montague, took the Vaudeville, a great
amount of public interest was displayed in the venture.&nbsp; The
new managers relied on burlesque as an opening experiment,
preceded by comedy.&nbsp; The comedy was provided by Andrew
Halliday.&nbsp; I forget who wrote the burlesque&mdash;Byron,
perhaps.&nbsp; But the fortunes of the managers were to be
founded by the new work of a new man, and the two burlesque
actors from the House of Swanborough were to be enabled to rely
thereafter on <a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
216</span>comedy, and to dispense entirely with burlesque.&nbsp;
The new author was James Albery; the new play, &ldquo;Two
Roses.&rdquo;&nbsp; For this production the services of Henry
Irving were engaged&mdash;an engagement which evinced
considerable managerial discretion, and, incidentally, gave
Irving his first real opportunity of making a hit with the London
public.&nbsp; All the members of the managerial triumvirate were
provided with strong parts.&nbsp; George Honey gave a memorable
impersonation of a good-hearted bagman&mdash;the &ldquo;Our Mr.
Jenkins&rdquo; of the bills.&nbsp; Some of his lines were
delivered with great unction.&nbsp; He comes under the influence
of his wife&rsquo;s religious belief, and evolves into what he
calls &ldquo;a shining light.&rdquo;&nbsp; He and his wife are
encountered by the heroine of the play.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Mr. Jenkins&mdash;or perhaps I should
ask, how do you shine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the mild effulgence of the glow-worm,&rdquo; is
the answer of Our Mr. Jenkins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are all worms,&rdquo; interpolates his wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my dear; <i>but we don&rsquo;t all
glow</i>,&rdquo; was the answer, given by Honey with a
half-deprecatory, half exultant expression that was simply
inimitable and delightful.</p>
<p>But the Digby Grand of Irving was, after all said and done,
the gem of the production.&nbsp; In all his after-life he never
surpassed it.&nbsp; Only once did he equal it.&nbsp; I have seen
Irving in every impersonation he gave in London, and I shall
always hold that he reached high-water mark with the selfish
swell of &ldquo;Two Roses,&rdquo; and that he touched that mark
for the second time with Matthias in &ldquo;The Bells.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Albery&rsquo;s &ldquo;Two Roses&rdquo; was succeeded by a
comedy from the same author called
&ldquo;Apple-Blossoms.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was not a success.&nbsp;
Nor, indeed, did Albery ever produce another play to equal his
first.&nbsp; I came to know him well; collaborated with him in a
small way; and visited him when he was living at Evans&rsquo;s
Hotel, and after he had furnished some pleasant chambers in
Southampton Street, Bloomsbury.&nbsp; He was an admirable talker,
a splendid listener, and possessed a pretty turn for unexpected
epigram.&nbsp; The Suffragette existed in those remote
days.&nbsp; But she practised <a name="page217"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 217</span>under another name.&nbsp; And the
questions of Woman&rsquo;s Rights and Female Emancipation were
argued as warmly then as now.&nbsp; The subject came up on one
occasion at Albery&rsquo;s rooms.&nbsp; His visitors were taking
sides.&nbsp; One strong believer in tradition took his stand on
Genesis, and asserted woman&rsquo;s inferiority on Scriptural
grounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Woman was made out of the rib of Man,&rdquo; he
declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And was thus a mere side-issue of creation,&rdquo;
suggested Albery.</p>
<p>Albery ended sadly.&nbsp; He became addicted to a habit which
ruined a good many of the best fellows of a convivial
period.&nbsp; His great gifts were wasted entirely in
conversational sallies, and among boon companions at the Savage
Club and other Bohemian resorts.&nbsp; He had married a lady who
subsequently &ldquo;went on the stage,&rdquo; and greatly
succeeded in her vocation, becoming one of the most popular
actresses of her time and of our own.&nbsp; A story of the days
of Albery&rsquo;s decadence has come to me.&nbsp; Some time
before his lamented death, and in a contrite mood, he called his
wife to his bedside, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, my dear, you should have married a different
man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>did</i>, Jim,&rdquo; was the tearful reply.</p>
<p>And there, I think, we plumb the very deeps of pathos.</p>
<p>It would be, however, an endless, exhausting, and
uninteresting task to pursue my friends the players through their
various theatres.&nbsp; The easier way is to catch them during
their hours of relaxation in their clubs and in their pubs.&nbsp;
The billiard-room of the Junior Garrick between half-past eleven
at night and two in the morning was a covert always successfully
drawn by those in search of theatrical game.&nbsp; Pool and
pyramids were the games most in vogue, but more especially
pool.&nbsp; Here you were sure of encountering
&ldquo;Jimmy&rdquo; Fernandez (I never knew an actor, however
sedate and inaccessible, who, being christened
&ldquo;James,&rdquo; was not called &ldquo;Jimmy&rdquo; by his
confr&egrave;res), a devoted exponent with the cue; H. B. Farnie
was rarely absent.&nbsp; He was a great hulking Scotsman with a
slight limp, of which he hated to be reminded.&nbsp; He had
originally <a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
218</span>been a medical student at Edinburgh.&nbsp; John Clarke,
of the Adelphi&mdash;no relation to John Sleeper Clarke&mdash;was
another of this coterie.&nbsp; He was a fine comic and character
actor.&nbsp; He was the husband of Miss Furtado, a favourite
Adelphi actress of the time.&nbsp; He played with unvarying
success under many managements, including that of the Bancrofts,
was of a grumbling disposition, and was known as Lame Clarke, to
distinguish him from the other John Clarke&mdash;Sleeper of that
ilk&mdash;lower down the Strand.</p>
<p>Clarence Holt, the tragedian, greatly fancied himself at the
game of billiards, and had succeeded in cutting more
billiard-cloths than any man living.&nbsp; Clarence Holt (his
real name was Jo) was a barn-stormer of the old school; and
although in general conversation he scowled, and made use of
weird expletives, he was as good-hearted a fellow as ever
lived.&nbsp; At the Saturday house-dinners of the club he
invariably gave a recitation of &ldquo;The Old Clock on the
Stairs,&rdquo; and always accepted with a sort of condescending
and regal dignity the ironical cheers which it invariably
evoked.&nbsp; His mingling of oaths with endearing epithets was
one of the quaintest things in the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is Miss Holt?&rdquo; one would ask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the dear, darling, bally little
idiot&mdash;she&rsquo;s well, dear boy, well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>James and Thorne were also habitu&eacute;s of the
billiard-room of the &ldquo;J.G.,&rdquo; as it was affectionately
called by its members.&nbsp; And, indeed, in the stifling
atmosphere of that room, which was situated in the upper part of
the house, you would meet from time to time one half the actors
in town.&nbsp; It was the favourite resort of the Swanboroughs,
and of many others whose names have escaped my memory.&nbsp; In
the Savage Club there was no billiard-room, but there was always
a good attendance of actors after the closing of the
theatres.&nbsp; The Garrick itself was never an actors&rsquo;
club in the exclusive sense of the word.&nbsp; One or two of the
upper crust of the &ldquo;profession&rdquo; always belong to it,
to justify and perpetuate the use of the title.&nbsp; But to the
rank and file of the calling it stands in the relation of
Paradise to the Peri.&nbsp; So that, beyond the Junior Garrick <a
name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>and the
Savage, the noble army of actors had no clubs.&nbsp; Their usual
meeting-places, therefore, became pubs.&nbsp; And these seemed to
be selected with a view to obtaining the utmost discomfort
conceivable combined with the highest scale of charges
possible.&nbsp; Thus, in the seventies the chief meeting-place of
the theatrical fraternity was a wine-bar in Russell Street,
Covent Garden, next door to the &ldquo;Hummums,&rdquo; and
occupying a site now covered by a market tavern.&nbsp; From one
to four o&rsquo;clock of an afternoon the wine-bar at
Rockley&rsquo;s was crammed with all sorts and conditions of
stage folk, and their contributory artistic aids&mdash;managers,
costumiers, authors, artists, journalists.</p>
<p>About half a dozen times in my life did I visit
Rockley&rsquo;s, but I retain the most vivid recollection of the
close atmosphere, the mingled smell of sawdust and port, the loud
buzz of conversation, and the frequent laugh that followed the
last new story or the smartly uttered retort.&nbsp; It will
suffice here to record the impression of a single visit.&nbsp;
The little man standing close to the bar, the centre of an eager
group intent on his poignant utterance, is Shiel Barry.&nbsp;
Barry was an Irishman, an actor of extraordinary intensity, and a
man of considerable general knowledge.&nbsp; He was an omnivorous
reader, and, when I first knew him, a great admirer of Carlyle,
some passages of whose &ldquo;French Revolution&rdquo; he recited
with a wonderfully lurid effect.&nbsp; I have recorded elsewhere
in this book my impression of his masterly interpretation of the
part of the miser in &ldquo;Les Cloches de
Corneville.&rdquo;&nbsp; His rendering of certain of the
characters in Dion Boucicault&rsquo;s Irish plays was equally
memorable and impressive.&nbsp; He was a master of pathos and
ferocity, and could at once attract or repel by the strange
realism of his embodiment of either emotion.&nbsp; The flamboyant
gentleman with the Louis-Napoleonic moustache is William Holland,
of the Surrey Theatre, the North Woolwich Gardens, the Circus at
Covent Garden, and finally manager of the Corporation&rsquo;s
amusements at Blackpool, which became this particular
Napoleon&rsquo;s St. Helena.&nbsp; Conversing with him is Dr.
Joseph Pope, familiarly known as &ldquo;Jo,&rdquo; and nicknamed
&ldquo;Jope.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dr. Pope had been a <a
name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 220</span>surgeon in
the army, serving in the Royal Artillery.&nbsp; He was a brother
of Mr. Sam Pope, Q.C., of the Parliamentary Bar.&nbsp; Jo had
been celebrated as the fattest man in the army, and Sam was
distinguished as the fattest man at the Bar.&nbsp; Sam was a
bachelor making an enormous income.&nbsp; Jo was a bachelor
living on his half-pay; and it used to be said, that when Jo was
in need of a remittance wherewithal to set right his balance at
Cox&rsquo;s, he would apply to Sam.&nbsp; If Sam proved
irresponsive, Jo at once threatened to go on to the music-hall
stage.&nbsp; That always &ldquo;fetched&rdquo; Sam, who hated the
Bohemianism in which Jo wallowed.</p>
<p>William Brunton discusses costume designs with Alias, and
Harry S. Leigh hums a new lyric which he has composed for a
production at the Alhambra.&nbsp; Brunton, espying me, edges
through the crowd to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you heard George Hodder&rsquo;s <i>non
sequitur</i>?&rdquo; he asks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; What was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;George was sent down to Stony Stratford by the <i>Daily
News</i>.&nbsp; When he woke up in the morning, he had forgotten
the name of the place.&nbsp; He rang the bell, and desired the
chambermaid to send &lsquo;boots&rsquo; to him.&nbsp; When that
menial appeared, George asked: &lsquo;Wh-wh-what&rsquo;s the
n-name of this p-place?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Stony
Stratford,&rsquo; answered &lsquo;boots.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Hodder, &lsquo;you may well c-call it
Stony Stratford&mdash;<i>for I never was so b-b-bitten with bugs
in the whole course of my l-l-life</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rockley&rsquo;s was at best a cramped and pestiferous inferno,
ill ventilated, and without a chair to sit down on.&nbsp; But its
customers made long stays, notwithstanding, and I understood that
a considerable amount of theatrical business was done on the
premises.&nbsp; It was a sort of rialto of the
&ldquo;profession.&rdquo;&nbsp; From Rockley&rsquo;s, the actor
and those who do business with him migrated to the new Gaiety bar
opened in the Strand.&nbsp; This was a horseshoe-shaped bar next
door to the theatre, much patronized by the Brothers Mansell, by
Henry Herman, by the then unknown D&rsquo;Oyly Carte, by several
of the Nationalist Members of Parliament, and by many of the
shapely members of the chorus from <a name="page221"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 221</span>burlesque theatres in the immediate
vicinity.&nbsp; It was leased by one &ldquo;Bill&rdquo; Bayliss,
who in after-years, and during the Beaufort period, conducted
Rule&rsquo;s, in Maiden Lane.&nbsp; For some years the Gaiety bar
remained a great afternoon centre for the
actors&mdash;particularly those who happened to be out of an
engagement and to retain an expensive thirst.&nbsp; During a
Gaiety <i>entr&rsquo;acte</i> I have smoked a cigarette in the
place, but regret that I have had no great personal acquaintance
with it.&nbsp; Its history for ten or twelve years from its
opening would be well worth writing by a man possessing the
requisite qualifications.</p>
<p>It was the last public-house meeting-place of stage
people.&nbsp; There are clubs now to suit every grade of
actor.&nbsp; And chorus girls are no more seen in bars.&nbsp;
They affect the swagger restaurants&mdash;and I, for one, cannot
blame them.&nbsp; A greater propriety in attire is observed by
the actor of to-day.&nbsp; He no longer affects a Quartier Latin
Bohemianism.&nbsp; He takes himself quite seriously as a social
unit.&nbsp; And with reason.&nbsp; For just as every citizen of
the United States is a possible President, so is every actor a
possible Knight, and every actress a possible &ldquo;my
lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To record the number of my theatrical acquaintances, and my
recollections, pleasant and unpleasant, of our forgathering,
would fill many chapters.&nbsp; The foregoing stray notes on my
friends the players are remarkable for the omission of many names
which I recall with the most lively sentiments of gratitude for
many a dull hour enlivened, and for many a joyous moment
heightened and prolonged.</p>
<h2><a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
222</span>CHAPTER XV<br />
<span class="GutSmall">&ldquo;THE &rsquo;ALLS&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">To</span> the patrons of the music-halls
of my early days about town, and to the performers in them, those
places of entertainment were never known as &ldquo;halls,&rdquo;
but always as &ldquo;&rsquo;alls.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nothing should
more eloquently indicate the vast change that has taken place in
their administration.&nbsp; In those days the
&ldquo;&rsquo;alls&rdquo; were held in general disrepute.&nbsp;
To-day their repute in the land is sweet and sound.&nbsp; They
have, indeed, ceased to be halls; they have become palaces.&nbsp;
And they have evidently come to stay, always widening their
sphere of influence, and proving, as time goes on, an increasing
source of anxiety to those who have invested their capital in
playhouses.</p>
<p>For the evolution of the theatre has been very gradual.&nbsp;
No great departure has been made on the boards since the playgoer
was taught to demand accuracy of detail in staging.&nbsp; That
was effected by the Bancrofts in the sixties.&nbsp; Managers have
since their day &ldquo;gone one better&rdquo; in the cost of a
production, in the gorgeousness of scenery and properties, in the
numerical force of their stage crowds.&nbsp; But nothing since
their production has been more appropriately acted and staged
than the Robertson series of comedies.&nbsp; And no
reproduction&mdash;whatever it may have cost&mdash;has proved an
artistic advance on the Bancroft presentation of the
&ldquo;School for Scandal.&rdquo;&nbsp; We have better theatres,
and we have more of them.&nbsp; The comfort of the auditorium has
been immeasurably increased.&nbsp; The space devoted to the stage
by our newspapers has quadrupled.&nbsp; The playgoing public has
grown enormously.&nbsp; But the playgoer has been <a
name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>marking
time all the while.&nbsp; And the dramatist, in this particular
respect, has been following the brilliant example of the
playgoer.</p>
<p>But if the drama has ceased to show itself progressive, if,
according to some, it even exhibits symptoms of decadence, the
evolution of the music-hall has been that of recovery, progress,
and reform.&nbsp; The music hall has risen &ldquo;on
stepping-stones of its dead self to higher things.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And only those who can recall the utter unloveliness of that
&ldquo;dead self&rdquo; can properly appreciate the privileges
accorded to the patrons of the halls and palaces as they are
conducted in this present year of grace.</p>
<p>To begin with, no woman of the period with which I am dealing,
with any regard for her reputation, would think of entering one
of these places of entertainment.&nbsp; She would run the
inevitable risk of being affronted by the patrons of the hall,
and being outraged by the words and gestures of the performers on
the stage.&nbsp; Phryne swarmed in the auditorium&mdash;poor
soul!&mdash;and by the bars lounged or swaggered the shameless
males, Jew and Gentile of his kind, who lived on the exploitation
of female beauty.&nbsp; The smaller halls, such as the Pavilion
(it was a small hall in those days); the Trocadero, which rose on
the ruins of the Argyll Rooms, and was run by old Bob Bignell;
the Oxford in Oxford Street; and Weston&rsquo;s in
Holborn&mdash;all were hot, ill-ventilated, and stuffy interiors;
and the moral atmosphere was as warm as the physical.</p>
<p>Having once got his customer more or less comfortably seated,
or propped up close to a bar, inside his
&ldquo;&rsquo;all,&rdquo; the main object of the proprietor was
to induce him to drink as much as possible of very bad wine and
spirits at positively fancy prices.&nbsp; Phryne, always hovering
near, exhibited a nice solicitude in forwarding the
proprietor&rsquo;s views in this direction.&nbsp; The waiters,
during the frequent &ldquo;waits,&rdquo; made a descent on the
stalls, and, forcing their legs through the exiguous spaces,
contributed largely to our discomfort.&nbsp; I recall the revenge
of a friend of mine on a waiter who had forced himself past us
for the fourth time.&nbsp; My friend was a Newmarket man, and was
up in London for the Epsom <a name="page224"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 224</span>Spring Meeting.&nbsp; A
whisky-and-soda stood on the little ledge in front of him.&nbsp;
As the waiter crushed past, my friend very neatly tipped his
glass over on to the floor.&nbsp; The glass fell shivered, the
waiter turned round, my friend denounced him for his clumsiness
and demanded that his glass should be replenished.&nbsp; The
waiter protested.&nbsp; But the manager of the
&ldquo;&rsquo;all&rdquo; decided against his menial.&nbsp; A
fresh drink and a new glass were provided, and not again during
the course of that evening did the waiter attempt to brush past
our stalls.&nbsp; Not quite honest on the part of my
friend?&nbsp; Perhaps not; but it was quite effective, and, under
the circumstances, what would you?</p>
<p>Originally the &ldquo;&rsquo;all&rdquo; was merely an annexe
to a big public house.&nbsp; The thing commenced in
&ldquo;harmonic clubs,&rdquo; &ldquo;free-and-easies,&rdquo; and
the like, and many of the customs and traditions of the
&ldquo;free-and-easy&rdquo; persisted for a long time under the
altered condition of things.&nbsp; Thus, the programme was, as
yet, an unknown document, and the singers were introduced by a
bibulous person who sat on an elevated armchair with his back to
the stage, and his eye roving over the house.&nbsp; To this day I
never can quite make out to what class of society the individuals
belonged who sat round the chairman&rsquo;s table.&nbsp; They
must have had money, for cigars and brandies-and-soda, and even
that champagne which was innocent of grape, were consumed at
their expense.&nbsp; An indifferent, honest crowd, no
doubt.&nbsp; Sharks, exploiters, billiard-markers, sporting
touts, reinforced from time to time by a contingent of moneyed
&ldquo;mugs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the &ldquo;Mogul&rdquo; in Drury Lane&mdash;afterwards
known as the &ldquo;Middlesex&rdquo;&mdash;presided nightly the
king, emperor, titulary chief, of chairmen.&nbsp; This was a man
named Fox.&nbsp; His face, encrimsoned by potations long and
deep, was large, and beamed with good-nature.&nbsp; His nose was
immense and pendulous&mdash;more a proboscis than a mere
nose.&nbsp; But the boys in the gallery&mdash;a rough lot they
were&mdash;took old Fox very seriously indeed.&nbsp; And it was
quite amazing to witness the way in which, by merely rising and
calling upon some delinquent by name, he could quell an incipient
riot among &ldquo;the gods.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thieves and their
trulls, the scourings of <a name="page225"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 225</span>Drury Lane tributaries, and the
lawless denizens of the turnings off the
&ldquo;Dials&rdquo;&mdash;they were quelled by the menace in his
eye, and trembled at the deep bass of his commanding voice.&nbsp;
Fox once sat to an artist friend of mine, and the resulting
picture was the very best Bardolph I have ever seen on
canvas.</p>
<p>When I was a young man &ldquo;seeing life&rdquo;&mdash;ay, and
tasting it, too, for that matter&mdash;I admit having gained some
experiences that I would quite gladly have missed.&nbsp; It is
inevitable that the memory will be charged with a reminiscence
which is recalled with disgust, and that many of the so-called
pleasures of youth leave a nasty taste in the mouth which is
never entirely displaced.&nbsp; The &ldquo;star comique&rdquo; is
one of those memories.&nbsp; George Leybourne was not at his
zenith when I first saw him.&nbsp; He had essayed to live the
life which he was supposed to depict on the stage&mdash;with the
usual result.&nbsp; But he still held the first claim on the
music-hall public.&nbsp; It is another circumstance marking the
complete and rapid evolution of the music-hall to note that forty
years ago George Leybourne held the same position with the
patrons of these establishments as was afterwards held by
Chevalier and Leno, and is at the present time of writing held by
Harry Lauder.</p>
<p>Leybourne was still singing &ldquo;Champagne Charlie is my
Name&rdquo; when I heard him, and the amusing sight was nightly
afforded of lawyers&rsquo; clerks from Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn, and
shop-boys from Islington, and young men-about-town on twenty-five
shillings a week, waving their mugs of beer or &ldquo;goes&rdquo;
of whisky, and madly joining in the exhilarating chorus as though
champagne was their daily beverage.&nbsp; But it was not to join
in his bacchanalian choruses that the greater part of the
audience crowded to hear Leybourne&rsquo;s songs.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;star comique&rdquo; was ever provided with offal for the
pigs in front.&nbsp; And it was when the orchestra began on the
opening bar of ditties like, &ldquo;Oh, why did she leave her
Jeremiah?&rdquo; that necks were craned and ears set.&nbsp; For
the pornographic part of the show was now &ldquo;on.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The words of the song itself did not offend save by reason of
their inanity.&nbsp; But between the verses the singer introduced
long monologues <a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
226</span>known to music-hall bards as something
&ldquo;spoken.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was in these &ldquo;spoken&rdquo;
interpolations that Leybourne &ldquo;let himself go.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He cheerily set out to discover how far a pornographic artist
could proceed with a music-hall audience.&nbsp; Sometimes he
played with suggestion and innuendo.&nbsp; But properly
encouraged and liberally stimulated, he would spurt filth from
his mouth as a juggler emits flames from the same orifice.&nbsp;
The more reckless he became, the more delighted grew his
audiences.&nbsp; That was Leybourne as I remember him.&nbsp; And
Leybourne was typical of the music-hall as it then was.</p>
<p>Off the stage poor George was a good-natured, light-hearted,
generous, and conceited fellow&mdash;the friend of bookmakers,
Cockney sportsmen, publicans, and sinners; and the model of the
mere middle-class boy in offices, who imitated his dress and
peculiarities, and regarded him as the mirror of Society.&nbsp;
The great man drove from hall to hall in a little carriage drawn
by a pair of wonderfully neat ponies.&nbsp; The champagne of his
evening ditties became the usual tipple of the artist during his
afternoon calls at his favourite bars.&nbsp; He drank, indeed,
many of the sweets of artistic success&mdash;adulation, flattery,
the favour of women, and the jealousy of men.&nbsp; He lived hard
and died hard-up.&nbsp; For even in his time the shadow of a
change was visible, though it was no bigger than a man&rsquo;s
hand.</p>
<p>Other music-hall artists there were who, however disinclined
they might feel in the matter, were obliged to follow in the wake
of the &ldquo;star comique.&rdquo;&nbsp; Arthur Lloyd was a
genuine humorist, and had a peculiar velvety quality of voice,
which was conspicuous by its absence in the throats of his
contemporaries.&nbsp; As an artist he was incomparably the most
accomplished, and the most versatile of the music-hall men of his
time.&nbsp; But though he got hold of some songs that enjoyed a
wide and long popularity, he never made one of those sensational
&ldquo;hits&rdquo; which have accidentally come in the way of
less-accomplished performers.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Great Vance&rdquo;
was another of the music-hall favourites.&nbsp; This wonderfully
overrated person belonged to the Leybourne school of thought, and
illustrated the swell of the period as accurately as was possible
by a man whose aspirates were <a name="page227"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 227</span>scarcely on a level with his
aspirations.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Great Macdermott&rdquo; came a
little later than the trio whom I have named, but was long
singing on the same stage as Lloyd and Vance, the popularity of
both of whom he was destined to eclipse.</p>
<p>Macdermott had been a sailor in the Royal Navy.&nbsp; I
remember his giving me on one occasion a most dramatic account of
how he came to leave the service.&nbsp; The general details I
forget.&nbsp; But there is impressed on my memory the picture of
Macdermott being rowed ashore in a jolly-boat, rising in the
stern-sheets, and, shaking his fist at his ship, exclaiming:
&ldquo;Her Majesty&rsquo;s Navy, adoo!&rdquo;&nbsp; In the
fo&rsquo;castle there is a constant demand for the very class of
song which was finding so much favour at the hands of the
groundlings when this songster took to the stage.&nbsp; And as a
follower of poor Leybourne, the sailor-man-turned-comedian made
his first efforts.&nbsp; He was minded if he could to &ldquo;go
one better&rdquo; than the creator of &ldquo;Champagne
Charlie.&rdquo;&nbsp; But that wonderful impersonator had already
sounded the depths.&nbsp; Macdermott, however, soon asserted his
claim to a second place with such compositions as &ldquo;Moses
and Aaron sat on a rock.&rdquo;&nbsp; These essays in an
equivocal genre brought the singer quickly to the front.&nbsp;
Yet it was not as an illustrator of pornographic minstrelsy that
Macdermott was to make his &ldquo;hit.&rdquo;&nbsp; When that
wave of patriotism which its detractors called
&ldquo;Jingoism&rdquo; swept the country, Macdermott was to the
fore as the laureate and bard of the patriots.</p>
<p>Macdermott, indeed, has enriched the dictionaries of more
nations than one with a new word.&nbsp; That is the word
&ldquo;Jingoism,&rdquo; as used in politics.&nbsp; He sang a
chorus in which we hurled defiance at the wide world, and soon
the wide world was singing it, too.&nbsp; Macdermott had a
wonderfully distinct enunciation, and had a peculiar knack of
emphasizing the initial letter of every word he sang.&nbsp; The
chorus which created the furore, as sung by the great man, went
in this way:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We Don&rsquo;t Want To Fight;<br />
But By <span class="smcap">Jingo</span> If We Do,<br />
We&rsquo;ve Got The Ships.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve Got The Men,<br />
We&rsquo;ve Got The Money, Too!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span>While
this ditty was the vogue, the Great Macdermott firmly believed
that he and Lord Beaconsfield were the two principal Conservative
forces of the day.&nbsp; With the capital he made out of his
patriotism he retired from the music-hall stage.&nbsp; Unkind
rivals declared that his patriotic howling had cracked his
voice.&nbsp; He set up a &ldquo;Music-Hail Agency&rdquo; in the
Waterloo Bridge Road, and joined the redoubtable Jack Coney in
&ldquo;making a book.&rdquo;&nbsp; History holds no further
record of him and his deeds.</p>
<p>About the same time James Fawn, Herbert Campbell, and Charles
Coborn, began to demonstrate to the public&mdash;and this fixes
their place in the elusive story of the evolution of the
music-hall&mdash;that it is possible to have a song in which
there shall be real humour, the nice delineation, a
&ldquo;taking&rdquo; tune, without any appeal to that which is
lowest and most bestial in the minds of the public.&nbsp; Then
followed Chevalier, Dan Leno, and the comic singers of the
present day, with whom, of course, these reminiscences have
nothing to do.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most deplorable feature in the entertainments
given by music-hall managers in the early days of my
acquaintanceship with those places of entertainment was the lady
performer.&nbsp; Those terrible young (or middle-aged) persons
who were announced as the &ldquo;Sisters&rdquo; So-and-So, and
were inevitable on every stage, always succeeded in putting a
portion of the audience into a bad temper.&nbsp; Their short
coloured skirts, their fixed smirk, the mechanical steps of their
dance, their metallic voices&mdash;these things have left an
impression not pleasant to recall.&nbsp; They couldn&rsquo;t
sing.&nbsp; They couldn&rsquo;t dance.&nbsp; And their
&ldquo;make-up&rdquo; proved that they couldn&rsquo;t even
paint.&nbsp; Still, there were women appearing before the patrons
of the &ldquo;&rsquo;alls&rdquo; who possessed the authentic
gift.&nbsp; One of the earliest of these was Jenny Hill.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The Vital Spark&rdquo; they used to call her on the
bills.</p>
<p>In her choice of subject she allowed herself a wide range,
alternating between the pathetic and the humorous.&nbsp; She was
very clever in depicting the coster class.&nbsp; She was the
forerunner of Bessie Bellwood in that department.&nbsp; And I
have always held that she was possessed of much higher <a
name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 229</span>artistic
qualities than fell to the lot of poor Bessie.&nbsp; And she had
the same readiness of retort when the &ldquo;gods&rdquo; in the
gallery felt called upon to interpose with humours of their
own.&nbsp; At the &ldquo;Mogul&rdquo; Jenny Hill had frequent
opportunities of exhibiting her skill in this direction, and
never failed to score off her saucy admirers on the slopes of
cloud-capped Olympus.&nbsp; Bessie Bellwood revelled in the same
sort of conflict.&nbsp; But it must be admitted that the older
artist had the command of a more subtle and good-humoured
method.&nbsp; Bellwood&rsquo;s retorts were often coarse, and
always stung.&nbsp; But, although the less accomplished performer
of the two, Bessie Bellwood made a quicker jump into fame and
achieved a wider popularity than her older rival.&nbsp; It was
another case of getting hold of a song that has a
&ldquo;hit&rdquo; in it.&nbsp; &ldquo;What cheer,
&rsquo;Ria!&nbsp; &rsquo;Ria&rsquo;s on the job!&rdquo; lifted
the unknown genius immediately into the front rank&mdash;a
position which she kept till her death.&nbsp; The regard in which
this absolutely untaught woman was held was shown by the
thousands of the public that turned out to follow her funeral,
and line the streets through which the procession to the cemetery
passed.</p>
<p>It was with the utmost difficulty that Bessie Bellwood could
be induced to study a new song.&nbsp; She had no love for
music.&nbsp; She had plenty of money, she was fond of racing and
Society and fun of all kinds.&nbsp; She could read and write, but
that was about all.&nbsp; Arthur Williams was the only man I ever
met who seemed to know anything of her early life, and he always
declared that her occupation, before she went on the stage, was
that of skinning rabbits in the East End.&nbsp; Notwithstanding
the obscurity of her origin and the paucity of her attainments,
she was the chosen domestic companion of a Duke and of a
Marquis!</p>
<p>It may seem strange, to a generation possessing only an
experience of the chastened variety theatre of the period, to
learn that in my day a person entirely lacking in education
should attain to a foremost position on the music-half
stage.&nbsp; But the thing was by no means uncommon.&nbsp; An
amusing case in point occurs to me.&nbsp; Hollingshead, of the
Gaiety, was always on the lookout for &ldquo;talent,&rdquo; and
he was <a name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
230</span>not at all particular as to the source from which he
drew it.&nbsp; Calling on him one day at the theatre, I found him
considerably upset by a discovery which he had just made.&nbsp;
He had long admired the performance of a certain music-hall
artist, and, when an opportunity arose, he offered him a part in
a burlesque then in course of preparation.&nbsp; Good terms were
offered.&nbsp; The music-hall artist was flattered, and the offer
was accepted.&nbsp; But when his part was handed to him by the
stage-manager, it was found to be of no earthly use to him, for
he could not read!&nbsp; Fortunately, the artist&rsquo;s
ignorance in other matters came to Hollingshead&rsquo;s
assistance in determining the engagement.&nbsp; For the contract
had been signed in the gentleman&rsquo;s name by a friend, and
was invalid!</p>
<p>One of those incidents by which one may note the progress of
an evolution comes in its natural order in this place.&nbsp;
Albert Chevalier had failed to obtain from the general public
supporting the theatre the amount of attention and critical
admiration that was accorded to him freely by the judicious
few.&nbsp; For years he was known at club banquets and the like
as the writer, composer, and singer, of those coster songs which
have since won for him fame and fortune.&nbsp; In a burlesque of
&ldquo;Aladdin&rdquo; put on at the Strand Theatre by Edouin,
Chevalier introduced his famous &ldquo;&rsquo;Armonic
Club.&rdquo;&nbsp; Its humours appealed for the moment, but it
did not make one of those &ldquo;hits&rdquo; the impact of which
sets all the town tingling.&nbsp; And for a long time after the
run of the Strand &ldquo;Aladdin&rdquo; Chevalier was unable to
obtain &ldquo;a shop.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was one of the many
unfortunate artists whose peculiar vein of talent had not found
the proper assay.</p>
<p>When he was at last offered an engagement as a music-hall
singer, he naturally hesitated at taking a step which he rightly
regarded as irrevocable.&nbsp; He recognized the fact that his
acceptance meant a renunciation of the theatre.&nbsp; And to his
profession&mdash;hard mistress though she had been&mdash;he was
deeply attached.&nbsp; I was one of those friends to whom he
repaired for advice over what appeared to him a momentous
issue.&nbsp; I am glad to recall the fact that I strongly advised
him to take the plunge.&nbsp; Nor was I ever in doubt as to the
success of his songs with an audience even then <a
name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 231</span>emerging
from under the spell of the raucous and &ldquo;rawty&rdquo;
comiques.&nbsp; A number of us went to the Pavilion to witness
his d&eacute;but.&nbsp; We had scattered ourselves all over the
hall&mdash;it was the new building, and not the stuffy old hole
of the seventies&mdash;and we were prepared to act as an
unsalaried claque.&nbsp; But our services were never
needed.&nbsp; With great judgment, Chevalier had selected as his
first song &ldquo;The Coster&rsquo;s Serenade.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
went home at once.&nbsp; The delicacy of the art appealed alike
to stalls and gallery.&nbsp; This refinement of treatment was
novel.&nbsp; It was something like a revelation to the
&ldquo;gods.&rdquo;&nbsp; The song went with a will.&nbsp; And
Chevalier&rsquo;s fortune was assured.&nbsp; We who had attended
as unpaid and unwanted claquers were not without a vocation,
after all.&nbsp; We were watchers at the parting of the
ways.&nbsp; The old music-hall of the Great Vances and the Bessie
Bellwoods was passing away.&nbsp; The new order of the Fragsons
and the Margaret Coopers was imminent.</p>
<p>It is difficult, in tracing the course of any evolution, to
attribute exactly the dates of transition, or to assign
scientifically the contributing causes of change.&nbsp; But I
think that one would not be far from the truth in attributing to
three causes the wonderful improvement which has taken place in
music-hall conditions and entertainments in the course of a
generation.</p>
<p>In the first place, the erection of more modern, more
pretentious, and more comfortable buildings on the ruins of the
ancient pest-houses almost necessitated a performance from which
should be eliminated the more objectionable features of the old
pothouse programme.&nbsp; In the second place, due importance
should be given to the persistent efforts of managers of the
Charles Morton school, who, foreseeing the possibilities of the
variety show, cherished high ideals, but cherished them on
strictly business lines.&nbsp; In the third place, one must allow
something for an improvement in public taste.&nbsp; This factor
is&mdash;for reasons which I cannot discuss here&mdash;the least
potent.&nbsp; But it is far from being negligible.&nbsp; It is a
case, indeed, in which the supply created the demand, not where
the demand created the supply.</p>
<p><a name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
232</span>Charles Morton, whose name must be imperishably
associated with the transformation of the halls, was the least
professional-looking manager in London.&nbsp; He was of short
stature, wore ginger-coloured side-whiskers, dressed in a
frock-coat and silk hat, and affected gold pince-nez.&nbsp; Asked
to guess at his calling in life, a stranger would probably have
put him down as the owner of a large suburban drapery
establishment, who acted on Sundays as sidesman at the nearest
church.&nbsp; And, truth to tell, Morton&rsquo;s innate sense of
decorum was so strong that his demeanour in the halls over which
he presided would have done credit to a churchwarden.&nbsp; No
man was ever half so respectable as Charlie Morton looked.&nbsp;
His work was none the less efficient and permanent on that
account.&nbsp; And it is satisfactory to reflect that he who had
commenced the crusade against pornography at the Canterbury, on
the other side of the water, should have lived to preside for
years over the fortunes of the Palace, in the heart of the West
End.</p>
<p>In the seventies the Alhambra was not reckoned&mdash;as it is
to-day&mdash;among the &ldquo;&rsquo;alls.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
Empire and kindred establishments were as yet undreamt of by the
pleasure-hunter.&nbsp; And the Alhambra was a thing apart.&nbsp;
Leicester Square, on the eastern side of which it is situated,
was then the most disreputable spot of earth to be found in the
centre of any capital in Europe.&nbsp; Here on the sunniest
summer days might be found promenading some of the most
villainous adventurers from the capitals of Europe.&nbsp; They
cloaked themselves like brigands, glared at the passing
shop-girls with wicked black eyes, twirled their fierce
moustaches, and rolled cigarettes with a diligence which they
gave to no other innocent pursuit.&nbsp; They were the
off-scourings of Europe.&nbsp; The swindlers, gamblers, political
rogues, the <i>souteneurs</i>, the craven shirkers of
conscription, the European riff-raff that chooses London as its
favourite dumping-ground, were all to be found promenading in
Leicester Square.&nbsp; John Leech has fixed the type in the
pages of <i>Punch</i>.&nbsp; The interesting
<i>&eacute;migr&eacute;</i> may still be detected prowling about
the vicinity.&nbsp; But he is a wonderfully ameliorated
brigand&mdash;a tame and nearly normal invader.&nbsp; The
improvement in <a name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
233</span>the enclosure itself accounts for this.&nbsp; The
squalor in which he throve as in his native element has
gone.&nbsp; And the picturesque but filthy villain has happily
gone with it.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Lee-cess-tare Squar&rdquo; of my
salad days is no more!</p>
<p>The paling that surrounded the gardens in the centre of the
square had been broken down.&nbsp; It became the receptacle of
the least sanitary parts of the rubbish of the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; And as the rubbish-heaps increased,
augmented by contributions of dead dog and dead cat, the gamins
of the place found it become more and more desirable as a
rallying-point and a playground.&nbsp; A statue of one of the
Georges bestrode an adipose charger (fearfully out of drawing) on
a pedestal in the centre of the enclosure.&nbsp; Everything of a
humorous and adventurous kind which took place in the West End in
those days was put down to the medical students of the
Metropolis.&nbsp; After a night of dense fog, the public passing
through the square discovered that the King&rsquo;s steed had
been given a coat of white paint relieved by black spots.&nbsp;
On another foggy night the same body of roisterers&mdash;or
another&mdash;unhorsed the monarch, and broke him into pieces,
scattering his remains on the ground; for the effigy was not
carved out of marble, but was a case of moulded metal.&nbsp; The
monarch was discovered to be a hollow mockery.&nbsp; For a time
the spotted horse dominated the squalid enclosure, grotesque and
riderless.</p>
<p>Then Baron Grant appeared upon the scene, and proceeded to
abate this Metropolitan nuisance.&nbsp; Grant was a
company-promoter of the well-known type.&nbsp; His real name was
Gottheimer; and he sought, but failed to obtain, a seat in
Parliament as a Member of one of the London divisions.&nbsp; He
built an enormous house in Kensington, known as
&ldquo;Grant&rsquo;s Folly.&rdquo;&nbsp; Before the mansion was
finished the owner went &ldquo;broke,&rdquo; and, as it was not
found suited to the requirements of any of the few millionaires
then in need of a town-house, it was pulled down and the
materials sold.&nbsp; The marble pillars supporting the ceiling
in the hall of &ldquo;Grant&rsquo;s Folly&rdquo; now adorn the
grill-room of the Holborn Restaurant.&nbsp; Grant, having
obtained the necessary permission, set about the task of
converting Leicester Square <a name="page234"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 234</span>into a beauty-spot.&nbsp; He hoped,
and, indeed, believed, that it would be opened to the public by
Royalty, and that he would be rewarded with an English
title.&nbsp; He desired, also, to further his designs on a
Metropolitan electorate.&nbsp; He was disappointed in both
directions; and his subsequent bankruptcy showed that both the
Queen and the wooed constituency exercised foresight in
disregarding his claims.</p>
<p>But, whatever the Baron&rsquo;s motives may have been,
Londoners owe him a considerable debt of gratitude in respect of
the transformation of the most disreputable public square in all
Europe.&nbsp; At no time has London shown itself over-anxious to
acknowledge the obligation, and to-day it has probably forgotten
all about its dead benefactor.&nbsp; I knew the Baron quite
well.&nbsp; He was a dapper, well-groomed, ambitious little
man.&nbsp; Had the tide not turned and swept him off his feet, he
would have gained admission to the House of Commons&mdash;one of
the few associations of English gentlemen by whom promoters of
the Baron Grant type are not merely tolerated, but even made
welcome.</p>
<p>Amid the filth and squalor of the un-reformed square the high
edifice of the Alhambra rose, giving the absent touch of the
Orient to a locality sheltering many swarthy sons of the
East.&nbsp; And there was something Oriental in the
entertainment, the chief feature of which was ballet.&nbsp; In
the seventies, and before the coming of the Empire and kindred
palaces, every man-about-town dropped in at the Alhambra at least
once during the week.&nbsp; He was sure to find himself among
friends.&nbsp; And in case that did not happen, he had offered to
him the easy opportunity of picking one up.&nbsp; The
establishment was owned by a company, the principal managing
directors being a bill-poster called Nagle, a friend of
Nagle&rsquo;s called Sutton, and Captain Fryer, a wine-merchant
in the City.&nbsp; Fryer had married the old Strand favourite,
Bella Goodall, and was a member of the Junior Garrick and other
theatrical clubs, in one of which I first made his
acquaintance.&nbsp; John Baum was the manager, and the
hard-working and inimitable Jacobi was <i>chef
d&rsquo;orchestra</i>.</p>
<p>John Baum, the manager, presented to the ordinary <a
name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span>observer
rather an interesting problem.&nbsp; He was at once manager of
the Alhambra, lessee of Cremorne, and the owner of a glove-shop
in Piccadilly, situated on or about, the spot on which the
fountain now stands; for at that time the open space which
spreads itself before the Criterion was covered by a triangular
block of buildings, the back of which faced the London Pavilion,
which then stood close by the Caf&eacute; Monico and a nasty
anatomical exhibition known as Dr. Kahn&rsquo;s Museum.&nbsp; The
exhibitor eked out a bare existence by pandering to the prurient,
and was at last compelled by the authorities to close his
unspeakably sorry show.&nbsp; But I must not side-track Baum in
describing his surroundings.&nbsp; He was a little, fair-haired
person with a rotund figure.&nbsp; He invariably appeared in
public in a tall hat, a black frock-coat, and a narrow black tie,
carefully fastened in a bow.&nbsp; But for a scrubby moustache,
he looked far more like a Dissenting parson than like a
music-hall manager.&nbsp; No one could have inferred from his
personal appearance that he could be in any way connected with
two such establishments as the Alhambra and Cremorne.</p>
<p>Baum was a most reticent man.&nbsp; Little or nothing was to
be got out of him in the course of conversation.&nbsp; He was at
the same time quite polite, and even affable, in his
manner.&nbsp; I once accepted his invitation to go and interview
De Groof, the intrepid adventurer, who was about to make an
aerial flight from Cremorne.&nbsp; At the present moment, when
aerial navigation has just come back, and come to stay, a short
reference to De Groof may not be considered out of place.&nbsp;
About De Groof himself there was nothing particularly
striking.&nbsp; His name notwithstanding, the aeronaut was a
Frenchman, and he reposed, or affected to repose, the most
absolute reliance on his machine.&nbsp; The latter was more of a
parachute than anything else.&nbsp; It consisted of two enormous
wings worked by pulleys.&nbsp; Between the wings a seat was fixed
for the accommodation of the flyer.&nbsp; The machine was to be
fixed to a balloon, from which it could be disconnected at will,
when it was expected to descend gracefully to the ground.&nbsp; I
did not witness the ascent, and so was spared seeing the
catastrophe.&nbsp; The balloon <a name="page236"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 236</span>failed to get away
satisfactorily.&nbsp; The weight of the machine in tow was no
doubt the cause; and De Groof, fearing collision with a
church-steeple in Sidney Street, Fulham Road, detached his
apparatus prematurely.&nbsp; The machine fell to the earth like a
stone, and the unfortunate inventor was instantly killed.</p>
<p>The Alhambra audiences were drawn by an exhibition of
terpsichorean art and female beauty.&nbsp; And establishments
devoting themselves to such an exhibition will have lots of
hangers-on.&nbsp; One of the most noticeable of these was an
exceedingly well-known but ancient and cadaverous-looking Hebrew
not wholly unconnected&mdash;if there was anything in current
report&mdash;with West End usury.&nbsp; He was supposed to be the
benefactor of beauty in distress&mdash;the guide, philosopher,
and friend, of impecunious maidenhood.&nbsp; Nor was his
philanthropy confined to members of the <i>corps de
ballet</i>.</p>
<p>Certain of the habitu&eacute;s of the house had an admission
behind the scenes to what was known as the &ldquo;canteen,&rdquo;
enjoying the privilege, which, strangely enough, seems to appeal
both to youth and old age, of drinking champagne made of
gooseberries in the company of ballet-girls in gauze skirts and
no bodices to speak of.&nbsp; It has always struck me as strange
that men accustomed to luxurious surroundings in their homes and
clubs can extract any pleasure in becoming temporary participants
of an existence the dominant note of which is squalor, in which
all the senses are disagreeably assaulted, and the inevitable
consequence of which is a poignant sense of personal
degradation!&nbsp; The &ldquo;canteen&rdquo; is, happily, a thing
of the past.</p>
<p>Before Baum&rsquo;s management of the Alhambra it was
conducted for a time by a man called Strange.&nbsp; This
gentleman had been previously a waiter at the St. James&rsquo;s
Restaurant&mdash;the &ldquo;Jimmy&rsquo;s&rdquo; of later
days&mdash;and he was running the show, I think, in 1870.&nbsp;
During that lurid year the Alhambra made a lot of money, for the
war feeling ran high, and the management astutely gave prominence
in its programme to rival national airs.&nbsp; Partisanship was
evoked.&nbsp; The house was nightly crowded by patriots on both
sides, and scuffles and encounters were among the ordinary
diversions of the <a name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
237</span>evening.&nbsp; It is wonderful to see how doughty and
valorous your fighting man who stays at home can be!&nbsp;
Strange was supposed by the supporters of the house to be
consumed by a hopeless passion for the <i>premi&egrave;re
danseuse</i>, who spurned his addresses.&nbsp; I never asked him
about it, for, although he always made an effort to be civil to
persons of my calling, he was a churlish fellow, and he wore
flowing side-whiskers, which was in itself an offence.&nbsp; Both
he and the object of his middle-aged affection have been dead
this many a day.</p>
<p>My memory of the Alhambra stage is as a dream of fair
women.&nbsp; Whether as ballet-girls, as singers, or as actresses
in opera-bouffe, the women engaged were always lovely.&nbsp; They
become visualized for me now in a procession of pretty faces and
divine forms.&nbsp; There is Kate Santley, fair-haired and
vivacious, and fresh from the music-halls and her success with
&ldquo;The Bells go ringing for Sarah!&rdquo;&nbsp; There passes
now Corn&eacute;lie D&rsquo;Anka, the golden-haired Hungarian,
with the Amazonian figure and the exquisite voice; and behind
her, as I look, looms, indistinct but recognizable, the figure of
an Oriental potentate visiting our shores&mdash;that, indeed, of
the Shah of Persia.&nbsp; Scasi, with her well-trained voice,
passes from the Alhambra to the Surrey Gardens.&nbsp; Scasi, as
will be seen, is Isaacs spelled backwards, and with the
superfluous &ldquo;a&rdquo; deleted.&nbsp; She was the daughter
of a furniture-dealer in Great Queen Street.&nbsp; The old Surrey
Gardens, for which she abandoned the Alhambra, was the scene of
the last appearance in public of the beautiful Val&eacute;rie
Reece&mdash;the late Lady Meux.&nbsp; Strange to think that the
delightfully irresponsible little Boh&eacute;mienne of the jocund
days should have evolved into the owner of a Derby
winner&mdash;Volodyvoski, which she leased to the American, Mr.
Whitney&mdash;and the organizer and provider of equipment to a
battery of artillery for service in South Africa.&nbsp; The name
of Julia Seaman calls up to me that lady&rsquo;s appearance in
&ldquo;The Black Crook,&rdquo; in which fine production she
played with extraordinary effect the part of the malignant
fairy.&nbsp; A more inspiring performance than that in which I
subsequently saw her at Paravicini&rsquo;s theatre in Camden
Town.&nbsp; She then essayed&mdash;not very
convincingly&mdash;the r&ocirc;le of Hamlet.</p>
<p><a name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
238</span>Pitteri was <i>premi&egrave;re danseuse</i> for more
years than it would be quite gallant to recall.&nbsp; Although
assuming the chief place in ballet, this famous dancer possessed
none of those sylph-like characteristics which are usually
associated with the chief of the ballerine.&nbsp; She was a lady
of opulent charms and large figure.&nbsp; In those days there was
always engaged in the Alhambra production that epicene
excrescence, the male ballet-dancer.&nbsp; At the Alhambra it was
the duty of this individual to support the figure of Pitteri as
she made a semicircle in the air, and to hold her when she
assumed those poses which alternated her spells of purely
terpsichorean exercise.&nbsp; The man ballet-dancer supporting
Pitteri earned his wages whatever they may have been.&nbsp;
Sara&mdash;known as Wiry Sal&mdash;was another favourite of the
Alhambra ballet.&nbsp; This lady belonged to the high-kicking,
athletic order of Corybantes.&nbsp; She was accompanied by two
other high-kickers, and the three became known about town as
&ldquo;the world, the flesh, and the devil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the reign of John Baum, the directors of the Alhambra
were for ever changing their manager.&nbsp; All sorts and
conditions of managers&mdash;from William Holland and Joseph Cave
up to John Hollingshead&mdash;had a try at it.&nbsp; But not one
of them seemed able to get along with the Nagles, the Suttons,
and the Winders, of the board of directors.&nbsp; One by one
these reactionaries died off, and under a reconstructed board and
an enterprising and settled management the establishment at
present flourishes like a green bay-tree.</p>
<p>One of the last occasions on which I visited the Alhambra in
my capacity as a member of the Press was on the occasion of
Sandow&rsquo;s appearance at that establishment.&nbsp; He
challenged and defeated a &ldquo;strong man&rdquo; who was then
drawing the town.&nbsp; After the performance we were invited to
a supper given in the champion&rsquo;s honour in a
caf&eacute;&mdash;the name of which I forget; it stood between
the Alhambra and the Cavour&mdash;for even in those early days
Sandow had a keen appreciation of the value of a
<i>r&eacute;clame</i>.&nbsp; Sir Reginald Hanson took the chair
on the occasion, and the police paid us a domiciliary visit at
one o&rsquo;clock in the morning.&nbsp; Our names <a
name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 239</span>and
addresses were solemnly taken down&mdash;a ceremony which
occupied much time; but we never heard any more of the
matter.&nbsp; Sandow has gone far since that frugal entertainment
of the London Press.</p>
<p>The caf&eacute; at which we were invited to sup with Sandow
must have occupied the site, or have been very close to it, once
devoted to the squalid orgies of &ldquo;The Judge and
Jury.&rdquo;&nbsp; Elsewhere in these rambling reminiscences I
have alluded to ineffaceable memories which one would willingly
expunge.&nbsp; Through life one looks back on experiences which
one would gladly forget, but cannot.&nbsp; They cling like burrs,
and pursue like an evil odour.&nbsp; My recollection of
&ldquo;The Judge and Jury&rdquo; furnishes such an
experience.&nbsp; I visited the place once.&nbsp; Nothing on
earth could induce me to pay it a second visit.&nbsp; The
entertainment was in two parts.&nbsp; The first consisted of a
mock trial presided over by &ldquo;Baron Nicholson.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Before this libidinous old president, &ldquo;barristers,&rdquo;
duly arrayed in wig and gown, called witnesses, male and female
of their kind, and proceeded to examine and cross-examine with an
amount of licence and obscenity that set up in the hearer a sort
of moral nausea.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Baron&rsquo;s&rdquo; charge to
the jury was a tissue of ribaldry and bawdry which to me seemed
simply awful, but which appealed to the habitu&eacute;s of the
squalid hall.</p>
<p>The trial at an end, Nicholson&rsquo;s bench was removed, and
behind it was seen to be a stage-curtain.&nbsp; To the strains of
a piano this was drawn up, and on a revolving platform were
discovered the figures of some women representing groups from the
classics.&nbsp; The goddesses of Olympus were more sadly aspersed
by this exhibition of shameless flesh than had been the Bench and
Bar of England by Nicholson&rsquo;s travesty.&nbsp; As the
platform revolved, the women, with nothing on save their pink
fleshings, smirked and leered at the audience in front.&nbsp;
Needless to say, the figures in this exhibition of <i>pos&eacute;
plastique</i> were neither young nor beautiful.&nbsp; The pink
fleshings could scarcely keep in place the sagging charms of a
mature Venus, the lank limbs and scraggy neck of Diana. . .
.&nbsp; Faugh! London knows better now.</p>

240</span>CHAPTER XVI<br />
<span class="GutSmall">MINE EASE AT MINE INN</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">People</span> have short
memories&mdash;particularly in the matter of benefits
received.&nbsp; To-day, for instance, it is the usual and the
correct thing to credit the London County Council with all that
has been accomplished for the beautification of London during
recent years.&nbsp; Yet the two greatest improvements carried out
in my time were not done by the Council at all.&nbsp; The two
municipal achievements to which I allude are the Holborn Viaduct,
and that magnificent boulevard, the Thames Embankment.&nbsp; Now,
these two enduring monuments of municipal enterprise and
foresight we owe to the old&mdash;and much-maligned&mdash;Board
of Works.&nbsp; When I gaze dismayed on the hideous structure at
Spring Gardens, which now admits the public through its bowels to
St. James&rsquo;s Park; and when, entering and traversing the
Park, I see the grim bastion that has been erected at the end of
the duck-pond, with the object, apparently, of dwarfing
Buckingham Palace into the likeness of a row of aristocratic
almshouses, I wonder whether we were not safer, when all is said
and done, in the hands of the reprobated &ldquo;Board of
Shirks,&rdquo; as it was called by the comic papers of its
day.</p>
<p>Give a man beautiful surroundings, and he will begin to live
up to his environment.&nbsp; With the wonderful improvement
effected on the face of London by the operations of the Board,
there became heard the still, small voice of a demand for more
beautiful living.&nbsp; The two main elements in living, I take
it, are eating and drinking.&nbsp; And, rightly or wrongly, I
have always synchronized the completion of the Viaduct and the
Embankment with the first noticeable advance in catering.&nbsp;
Before that point of departure there <a name="page241"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 241</span>were in London but two restaurants
of the first class at which one could obtain a French
dinner.&nbsp; One of these was the Caf&eacute; Royal; the other
was Verrey&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Both were&mdash;and still, happily,
are&mdash;situated in Regent Street.&nbsp; To-day we have
restaurants which quite easily surpass in elegance and amplitude
of interior the two houses I have named, but the Caf&eacute;
Royal still holds its own both in the matter of cellar and of
cuisine.</p>
<p>There were humbler retreats at which the French manner of
dining might be enjoyed.&nbsp; Soho was full of these small
eating-houses at which the customers might either dine
<i>&agrave; la carte</i> at a moderate cost, or eat a dinner of
the <i>table d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te</i> order for eighteen pence,
with half a bottle of wine thrown in.&nbsp; For this you would
get a <i>soup maigre</i>, a <i>sole au vin blanc</i>, an
entr&eacute;e, a bit of chicken, a morsel of Brie or Camembert,
and the smallest possible collection of nuts and raisins on a Tom
Thumb plate, which was written down &ldquo;dessert&rdquo; on the
menu.&nbsp; As a rule the dinner was not half bad, and the wonder
was how it could be done at the price.&nbsp; Of the wine one
cannot talk so enthusiastically.&nbsp; Charles Lever once
described a vintage which he tasted in Italy.&nbsp; He spoke of
it as &ldquo;a pyroligneous wine, distilled from vine-stalks, and
agreeable in summer&mdash;with one&rsquo;s salad.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This admirably sets forth the virtues of the sour but ruddy
products of Bordeaux which were &ldquo;thrown in&rdquo; by the
enterprising exiles who catered in Soho.&nbsp; The best of these
smaller restaurants was Kettner&rsquo;s, in Church Street, close
to where the Palace Theatre now stands.&nbsp; It is difficult,
when one enters the elegant rooms which are now known as
Kettner&rsquo;s, to call up its small beginnings.&nbsp; Many of
its old customers cursed the day when it was
&ldquo;discovered&rdquo; by Mr. E. S. Dallas, of the
<i>Times</i>.&nbsp; Dallas was a man who could not keep a
secret.&nbsp; Having found out what a wonderfully well-cooked
dinner the little restaurant in Church Street could supply to the
customer for a very trifling cost, he must needs go and proclaim
the fact from the house-tops of Printing House Square.&nbsp; All
London began to flock to Church Street, and all London was
delighted to see Madame Kettner presiding as <i>dame du
comptoir</i>, and to learn that <a name="page242"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 242</span>the dainty dishes provided were
prepared by Monsieur Kettner in the basement below.&nbsp; This
influx of visitors brought about increased accommodation,
improved service, a greater luxury in the surroundings, until
Kettner&rsquo;s became what it is to-day&mdash;a West End resort
with some considerable support from fashionable society.</p>
<p>Prices went up, too.&nbsp; Dallas, who had very appropriately
signed his letter to the leading journal &ldquo;A Beast at
Feeding-time,&rdquo; could no longer get a portion of <i>sole au
vin blanc</i> for sixpence, and the poor French exiles who were
wont to forgather in Kettner&rsquo;s little dining-room in Church
Street were driven forth to seek sustenance elsewhere in the
fastnesses of Soho.&nbsp; I wonder what those patient old
<i>&eacute;migr&eacute;s</i> would have said concerning an
incident which happened to me some few years since at this famous
restaurant?&nbsp; I was dining in a private room as the guest of
a man who was wanting to &ldquo;do business&rdquo; with me.&nbsp;
Beside myself there was one other guest.&nbsp; After dinner our
host, who was a non-smoker, asked us to have a cigar.&nbsp; He
called the waiter.&nbsp; Cigars were ordered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wat price, sare?&rdquo; inquired the servant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best you have will not be too good for my
friends,&rdquo; declared our host in an expansive mood.</p>
<p>The cigars came&mdash;big things swathed in gold-foil.&nbsp;
We took a cigar each, and St. Georgi, who had married the widow
Kettner and was now running the show, came in to see how we were
getting on.&nbsp; Him also our host asked to have a cigar.&nbsp;
St. Georgi complied.&nbsp; That made three cigars in all.&nbsp;
At last the time came for paying.&nbsp; The bill was brought
in.&nbsp; The founder of the feast ran his eye over it.&nbsp; The
document was quite in order&mdash;save for one item.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, waiter, what the doose is the meaning of this
fifteen shillings?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three cigars, sare,&rdquo; he replied sweetly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifteen shillings!&rdquo; exclaimed our non-smoking
host.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry, sare,&rdquo; replied the waiter, looking
very sad indeed; &ldquo;<i>but we have none
better</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a palpable hit.&nbsp; Our friend joined in the
laugh&mdash;and paid.</p>
<p><a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 243</span>One
of the most characteristic of these foreign eating-houses on
English soil was the Caf&eacute; l&rsquo;&Eacute;toile, in one of
the streets&mdash;Rupert Street, I think it was&mdash;which run
off Coventry Street, parallel to Wardour Street.&nbsp; This place
was one half restaurant, and one half cabaret.&nbsp; A door and a
passage led from the one to the other.&nbsp; In the restaurant
the usual eighteen-penny dinner of many courses was served, and
the usual bottle of vinegary wine was &ldquo;thrown
in.&rdquo;&nbsp; The company, if not select, was at least
sedate.&nbsp; Your Frenchman in London is by no means as gay a
creature as on his boulevards at home.&nbsp; And the few English
who joined him at his frugal meal in the Caf&eacute;
l&rsquo;&Eacute;toile as a rule maintained their insular
<i>mauvais honte</i>.</p>
<p>But in the adjoining cabaret things were very different.&nbsp;
Here the bearded exiles were enveloped in such an impenetrable
cloud of smoke that they had forgotten all about their
<i>milieu</i>.&nbsp; They had created here their own atmosphere,
so to say.&nbsp; And a particularly villainous atmosphere it
was&mdash;sulphurous and pestiferous.&nbsp; The chatter was
incessant and strident.&nbsp; The clatter of the dominoes on the
tables, the noise of the impact of the mugs and
glasses&mdash;these mingled indistinguishably with the universal
din.&nbsp; In this stifling atmosphere might be encountered some
of the off-scourings of Continental cities.&nbsp; The political
refugee, finding security in a country that could afford to treat
him with absolute contempt, talked treason only when in his
cups.&nbsp; Here was the practical politician also&mdash;the
dynamitard, the artificer of bombs, the professor of the stiletto
and the revolver.&nbsp; Scotland Yard had the dossier of every
frequenter of the Caf&eacute; l&rsquo;&Eacute;toile duly
consigned by the police authorities of Paris, Berlin, and St.
Petersburg.&nbsp; It was the most noisy, the most stuffy, the
hottest, the dirtiest, the most polyglot, little hell in all
London.&nbsp; I do not know, but I strongly suspect that a too
constant solicitude on the part of Scotland Yard led to its
disappearance.&nbsp; Its site is occupied by a restaurant called
the West End Hotel, the reputable successor of an unsavoury
progenitor.</p>
<p>To William Gorman Wills I owe my introduction to most of the
Soho restaurants.&nbsp; Wills liked the company he found <a
name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 244</span>in these
places, and he liked the prices; for he was seldom well
off.&nbsp; Money flowed from him in all directions, so that he
never had much for his own use.&nbsp; It was lent or given in
lumps as soon as it was received, a good deal of it finding its
way into the pockets of impostors.&nbsp; For Wills was a man of
genius&mdash;one of the few I have ever met&mdash;and inherited
that financial incapacity which is the birthright of men of
genius.&nbsp; He was an artist first of all, and had a studio in
the Brompton Road, in a crescent which stood where the
Consumptive Hospital now stands.&nbsp; He was a musician of
distinction.&nbsp; He wrote a novel which would have made the
reputation of any man who paid attention to the social arts which
expedite the arrival of Fame.&nbsp; He will, perhaps, be still
remembered by the public for his many contributions to the
stage.&nbsp; His &ldquo;Charles I.,&rdquo; produced at the Lyceum
for Irving, was one of the most poetical acting plays of the last
century&mdash;Byron, and Lytton, and Sheridan Knowles, to the
contrary, notwithstanding.&nbsp; In his search after French
cookery he was instant.&nbsp; And I remember the delight with
which he took me to Charlotte Street, Fitzroy Square, where a new
caf&eacute; had been opened.&nbsp; The dining-saloon consisted of
the two ground-floor rooms of an ordinary house thrown into
one.&nbsp; Wills waved his arm as if to indicate to me fine
spaces&mdash;like those of the Louvre for instance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the artists of the neighbourhood will dine
here,&rdquo; be declared with conviction.&nbsp; &ldquo;If we
could only get old Madox Brown to come here once, he would never
go to the trouble of having dinners cooked at home!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madox Brown lived in Fitzroy Square, so that the convenience
of the arrangement seemed indisputable.&nbsp; And Charlotte
Street, as well as some other streets with long first-floor
windows, was still a thoroughfare in which artists set up their
studios.&nbsp; The Bohemia of &ldquo;The Newcomes&rdquo; was
still existing north of Oxford Street when I first knew London,
and when I have visited Madox Brown in Fitzroy Square it has
given me pleasure to think that his might be the very building
which was tenanted for a time by Colonel Newcome.&nbsp; But if a
tithe of the artists then working <a name="page245"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 245</span>in that part of the town were to
demand a meal at the restaurant newly discovered by Wills, the
majority of them must have had their dinner served to them in the
street.&nbsp; An invasion even of the members of the Madox Brown
family would have strained the resources of the tiny place to the
utmost.</p>
<p>At the time when Wills was making daily discoveries among the
little French eating-houses of Soho and Bloomsbury, he had few
imitators in that field of gastronomies.&nbsp; The Englishman
still pooh-poohed the French cuisine.&nbsp; He never hesitated to
express his contempt for what he called
&ldquo;kickshaws.&rdquo;&nbsp; Give him a basin of mock turtle
soup, a bit of boiled turbot, a cut off the joint, and two
vegetables, with apple pudding and Stilton cheese to end up with,
and he wouldn&rsquo;t thank you for the finest repast conceived
by the first chef, and prepared by the most expert assistants in
Europe!&nbsp; There are still fine old English gentlemen who hold
this heresy; but they all held it then.&nbsp; The consequence is
that half the population, over fifty years of age, suffer from
indigestion.&nbsp; But while this most barbarous standard of
dining obtained, it was faithfully catered for by the fine old
English gentleman&rsquo;s staunch admirer&mdash;the fine old
English landlord.&nbsp; And to this day there persist a few
establishments which make it their business to supply the fine
old English dinner for the fine old English gormandizer.</p>
<p>In the early seventies all the hotels, and almost all the
restaurants, supplied nightly the heavy meals that then
represented the national taste.&nbsp; In an earlier chapter I
have alluded to the Rainbow in Fleet Street, and to the Albion in
Russell Street, Covent Garden.&nbsp; These were typical.&nbsp;
Simpson&rsquo;s in the Strand was run on the same lines.&nbsp;
This was a very famous house of its kind.&nbsp; I have not
visited the place since it was rebuilt during the alterations at
the Savoy.&nbsp; But it carries on the old tradition, I
understand; that is to say, a customer can still have his slabs
of fish and his thick cuts from the joint, but he is granted an
option.&nbsp; He may have his food served in daintier
guise.&nbsp; The smoking-room at Simpson&rsquo;s was a great
rendezvous for men who knew good whisky and were judges of a
cigar.&nbsp; <a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
246</span>For the cigar divan next door to the restaurant was
really part of the concern.&nbsp; It was in that little
smoking-room that I first met Charles Kelly, the actor.&nbsp; He
became the second husband of Ellen Terry, and was one of the most
charming men I have ever known.&nbsp; His real name was Wardell,
and he had thrown up his commission in a crack cavalry regiment
to &ldquo;go on the stage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Simpson&rsquo;s was celebrated for something beside its
typical old English fare, its excellent whisky, and its
incomparable cigars.&nbsp; In a certain upper chamber at
Simpson&rsquo;s there were accustomed to meet all the most
eminent chess-players of the day.&nbsp; Steinmitz and Blackmore
could be found there on most afternoons.&nbsp; And, although it
was known in the outside world that they could be seen without
any let or hindrance on the part of the proprietor, their privacy
was never invaded.&nbsp; Only amateurs of the game entered the
chess-room.&nbsp; Your true Londoner differs in this from the
citizens of other towns: he never intrudes where he is not
wanted.&nbsp; As to the restaurant below, the dinner there was
served in a square saloon at the back of the building.&nbsp; The
joints were trundled up to the customers on
&ldquo;dumbwaiters&rdquo; running on castors.&nbsp; The meal was
of the usual heavy, stodgy description.&nbsp; The older diners
ate heartily, and, as a rule, suffered horribly from
dyspepsia.&nbsp; The waiters breathed hard, exhibited signs of a
bibulous habit, and possessed the largest feet of any men I have
seen either before or since.</p>
<p>In Covent Garden, the Tavistock, the Hummums, and the
Bedford&mdash;each of them hotels&mdash;served the same class of
dinner.&nbsp; At these comfortable resorts the meal was generally
followed by a bottle of port, thus insuring the achievement of
that indigestion which the stodgy comestibles may have failed to
set up.&nbsp; The ordinary English restaurant was supplemented by
the chop-house.&nbsp; In the City, where quick lunching is a
desideratum, these establishments flourished exceedingly.&nbsp;
In the West End the most noted of them was Stone&rsquo;s, in
Panton Street, at that period a thoroughfare with a bad name, but
at the present time purged of its earlier reputation.&nbsp; It
has a theatre, some <a name="page247"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 247</span>elegant restaurants, and exhibits
few signs of its squalid past.&nbsp; Panton Street has forsworn
sack, and lives cleanly.</p>
<p>But this chapter is not designed as a mere catalogue of the
catering houses, but as the rough sketch of an evolution
illustrated by examples, and illuminated here and there, I hope,
by anecdotes, relevant and irrelevant.&nbsp; I have sufficiently
shown that the Englishman of the early seventies, dining from
home, liked to have served to him the same sort of meal which was
provided for him on Sundays in the bosom of his family.&nbsp; The
Caf&eacute; Royal catered mainly for foreigners.&nbsp; It and the
Caf&eacute; Verrey were&mdash;so far as Londoners were
concerned&mdash;but two voices crying in the wilderness.&nbsp;
While as for the minor French restaurants in Soho, only artists,
poets, and other degenerate Englishmen, affected those cheery
little outposts of a great army which was presently to take
possession of the town.&nbsp; To-day the conquest of London by
the foreigner is complete.&nbsp; The French cuisine has been
adopted in all the principal hotels and restaurants, and the old
fish-joint-sweets-and-Stilton menu has been relegated to the
howling wilderness.</p>
<p>I will give three instances of the progress of the
reform.&nbsp; I select Gatti&rsquo;s in the Strand,
Romano&rsquo;s in the same thoroughfare, and Pagani&rsquo;s in
Great Portland Street.&nbsp; Of the three, Gatti&rsquo;s is the
least characteristically French, although an excellent French
meal may be obtained there.&nbsp; The Gattis aimed to be all
things to all men; and I hope it may not prejudice the reader if
I mention that it is to-day a favourite resort of Mr. Lloyd
George, who may frequently be seen at the Adelaide Gallery in
company with a brother Welshman, the esteemed proprietor of
<i>Ally Sloper</i>.&nbsp; The growth of the Gatti concern is one
of the commercial marvels of the day.&nbsp; It started as a
caf&eacute; in Adelaide Street, where fried chops and steaks with
chipped potatoes were served on marble-topped tables.&nbsp; The
meal was washed down with generous draughts of coffee or
chocolate, and the prices were strictly moderate.&nbsp; To-day
the establishment has struck right through into the Strand, and
spread itself halfway along Adelaide Street.&nbsp; Its
proprietors own two playhouses in the immediate
vicinity&mdash;the Adelphi and the Vaudeville&mdash;<a
name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 248</span>and supply
half the Strand with electric current from their own
dynamos.&nbsp; It is the culinary Mecca of the suburban, and
actors as well as Chancellors find it a convenient place at which
to lunch.</p>
<p>As a rule a restaurant fails or forges ahead on its own merits
or demerits.&nbsp; But now and then the chance visit of an
influential customer lifts it from obscurity into the warm light
of popular favour.&nbsp; You have seen how E. S. Dallas made the
fortune of Kettner&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Carr&rsquo;s, in the Strand,
was made by an article which appeared in <i>All the Year
Round</i>, an article which was generally attributed to Dickens,
but was in reality the work of one of his staff&mdash;Sala,
Halliday, Hollingshead, or another; in fact, the writers on that
magazine had so entirely acquired the descriptive trick of
&ldquo;the Master&rdquo; that it was a difficult thing to
&ldquo;tell t&rsquo;other from which.&rdquo;&nbsp; Poor
Pellegrini was the man who discovered Pagani&rsquo;s.&nbsp; It
was a poky little place, indifferently patronized, when he first
entered it.&nbsp; But he soon discovered that he could get there
spaghetti cooked and served as in his native Italy.&nbsp; It was
served, too, with a puree of tomato very different from the
watery and acid preparation to which in this country we had
become habituated.&nbsp; Tosti the composer followed where
Pellegrini had led.&nbsp; The small refreshment-room was
enlarged; an &ldquo;artists&rsquo; room&rdquo; was established
upstairs.&nbsp; At last adjoining premises were acquired.&nbsp;
Old Pagani&rsquo;s was rebuilt into the handsome and popular
restaurant as it is known to the present generation of
diners.&nbsp; The Paganis have retired on substantial fortunes to
the mountainous land of their nativity.</p>
<p>In carrying out structural alterations, the Paganis, with
characteristic astuteness, determined that the
&ldquo;artists&rsquo; room&rdquo; should not be tampered with by
the builders.&nbsp; In London no interior is so rich in mural
decorations contributed, gratis and off-hand, by distinguished
men using the apartment.&nbsp; Tosti has written up some bars of
a song, dear old Pellegrini has contributed some sketches, and
other artists have from time to time added to the exhibition,
happy to enrich it if only by an autograph.&nbsp; The sketches,
signatures, and bits of musical composition, have been <a
name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>covered
with glass.&nbsp; In other respects the famous upper chamber
remains much what it was in the old days.&nbsp; In that room I
have spent many happy, interesting, and memorable nights.&nbsp;
One of the most memorable of these was on the occasion of a
supper given by my friend Patrick Edward Dove, to the members of
the first company that performed &ldquo;Cavalleria
Rusticana&rdquo; in London.&nbsp; Dove was a barrister of
Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn, famous for his knowledge of Patent Law, his
acquaintance with the music of the bagpipes (he had made a
collection of several hundred pibroch &ldquo;scores&rdquo;), and
his unerring taste as a gastronome.&nbsp; When last I visited
Pagani&rsquo;s, they still mixed a salad known as <i>salad
&agrave; la Dove</i>.&nbsp; The new opera had been produced at
the Shaftesbury, conducted by Arditi, and the tenor part had been
entrusted to Vignas, a singer new to the town.&nbsp; All the
principals responded to Dove&rsquo;s invitation, and the
&ldquo;artists&rsquo; room&rdquo; became the arena of more noise
and enthusiasm than had ever been exhibited there before.&nbsp;
The tenor turned up rather late, being, I have no doubt, a nice
judge of the psychological moment at which to contrive a dramatic
entrance.&nbsp; These children of art and of the South proceeded
&ldquo;to signify their approval in the usual
manner.&rdquo;&nbsp; They rushed upon the poor man, and&mdash;men
and women alike&mdash;fell upon his neck and kissed him.&nbsp; To
a mere Englishman the scene was rather embarrassing.&nbsp; But it
was soon over, and the rest of the night passed in immense
chattering and jabbering, everybody seeming to talk at once, and
the utmost amity and joyousness informing the polyglot crowd.</p>
<p>In the early days of Pagani&rsquo;s the patrons of the
restaurant were nearly all Italians, and among them the most
picturesque figure was that of a very old gentleman with long
silvery hair, extremely classic features, and scrupulously clean
linen, a circumstance remarkable in an Italian restaurant of the
period.&nbsp; The old gentleman made his appearance each day
between twelve and one, and was always respectfully saluted by
his compatriots.&nbsp; He had a very frugal midday meal,
consisting principally of a decoction of eggs in a tumbler.&nbsp;
After this he would sit chatting over his coffee with friends,
who took chairs near him, until <a name="page250"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 250</span>well on into the afternoon.&nbsp;
They were informal receptions of a kind, these afternoons of the
handsome old man; for he had been Garabaldi&rsquo;s doctor, and
naturally was held in high regard by his compatriots.&nbsp; His
disappearance all at once from his accustomed place was, of
course, much commented on.&nbsp; It was supposed that he was
ill.&nbsp; On inquiry, however, it was discovered that he was
only married.&nbsp; A lady had fallen in love with the dear old
chap, carried him off, and married him.&nbsp; The bride probably
considered that the domestic hearth was more suited to her
husband than life in restaurants, and so Pagani&rsquo;s knew him
no more.</p>
<p>Romano had been a waiter at the Caf&eacute; Royal; and while
engaged in this capacity he must have picked up a great deal of
experience of London Society and its ways, which stood him in
good stead when he found himself the owner of a smart restaurant
in the Strand.&nbsp; A good many men, and, indeed, some
well-known publications, like to pose as the
&ldquo;discoverers&rdquo; of Romano&rsquo;s.&nbsp; As a matter of
fact, Romano was discovered by George Piesse, an epicurean West
End book-maker; and its first regular customers were the London
representative of the <i>New York Herald</i>, and the ubiquitous
and frugal &ldquo;Ape.&rdquo;&nbsp; It gradually became known to
those who liked <i>&oelig;uf &agrave; la cocotte</i> and other
Parisian delicacies.&nbsp; Then it made one of those sharp and
sudden ascents into popularity, its prices ascending with a
proportionate sharpness and suddenness.&nbsp; At luncheon-time
there was a difficulty in getting a table in the long narrow
saloon, looking like a disused shooting-gallery.&nbsp; The bar
that ran in front was crammed with book-makers, pressmen,
chorus-ladies, champagne-shippers, and young peers seeing
life.&nbsp; In a word, Romano&rsquo;s was
&ldquo;booming.&rdquo;&nbsp; Bessie Bellwood made it one of her
usual haunts of an afternoon; Hughie Drummond dropped in after a
day on the Stock Exchange; &ldquo;Billy&rdquo; Fitzwilliam was a
supporter of its clever proprietor; poor &ldquo;Kim&rdquo;
Mandeville (afterwards Duke of Manchester) was a regular
customer.&nbsp; The two least popular members of the congregation
joined somewhat later.&nbsp; These were the Marquis of Ailesbury
and Abingdon Baird, commonly called &ldquo;the
Squire.&rdquo;&nbsp; These <a name="page251"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 251</span>two gentlemen rarely appeared in
public except accompanied by a couple of &ldquo;bruisers,&rdquo;
and their attitude to society in general entirely justified the
precaution they took in providing themselves with
bodyguards&mdash;or body-blackguards, shall I say?&nbsp;
Romano&rsquo;s was for a long time the rallying-point of the more
rapid section of men-about-town and their lady friends.&nbsp; But
it was always more than this.&nbsp; Romano had learned his
business in the best French school in London, and in his catering
he always regarded the traditions of <i>la haute cuisine</i>, and
he had a fine taste in wine, the advantages of which were at the
disposal of his customers.</p>
<p>The evolution which I have described as working itself out in
three establishments, all of which originated in small and
unpromising beginnings and under somewhat adverse conditions, was
elsewhere evident.&nbsp; While the small caravanserai of Soho,
with its cheap dinner and <i>vin compris</i> was extending itself
into the outer streets, and even as far as the suburbs, the
founding of more swagger restaurants was taking place all round,
and competent chefs began to look to London, and not any more to
Paris, as the summit of their ambition.&nbsp; The Savoy was one
of the first to take full advantage of the new direction of
public taste.&nbsp; But at the present moment it has a hundred
competitors, from the restaurant at the Waldorf, on the eastern
confines of dinner land, to the Ritz, on its western
frontier.</p>
<p>Having now indicated the extent and importance of the reform
which has been effected in our eating and drinking during the
passing of a few short years, I must return for a moment to my
muttons, and record one or two of the fading memories of other
days.&nbsp; There was a table reserved in the Caf&eacute; Royal
grill-room at which, of an afternoon, there was always a
considerable amount of laughter.&nbsp; Here were wont to meet
MacMahon, the inventor of the electric &ldquo;tape&rdquo;
machine; Jenks, a gentleman who had made a million by running
gaming-hells; Ives, of the <i>Morning</i>; and Jo Aaronson, the
brother of the well-known New York entrepreneur.&nbsp; There were
others who were made welcome at this grill-room gathering, so
that as often as not the table had to be doubled by adding
another.&nbsp; Aaronson was <a name="page252"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 252</span>a quaint American with a national
sense of humour, a nice knowledge of the moment at which to
&ldquo;chip in&rdquo; with a story, and a slight stutter, which
gave an added value to everything he said.&nbsp; I remember one
day quite well when, with a face drawn and melancholy, he
recounted to us the details of a misfortune which had overtaken
him.&nbsp; His uncle John had died in London, and Jo had been
entrusted with the melancholy duty of having the body cremated
and buried.&nbsp; Jo described the cremation with great detail
and picturesqueness, showed himself receiving the sacred ashes in
an urn, and hurrying with his precious vase to the
railway-station, in order to catch a train to town.&nbsp; When Jo
arrived in town, he hurried out of the train, got into a cab, and
automatically told the driver to go to his club.&nbsp; It was not
until Jo arrived at the club that he recollected that he had
forgotten all about Uncle John!&nbsp; He had placed the ashes of
the deceased in the hat-rack of the railway-carriage in which he
had travelled, and, when he arrived at Waterloo, had forgotten
all about it.&nbsp; And the ashes of Uncle John have not been
recovered even unto this day.</p>
<p>The caf&eacute; off which the grill-room opens, and which
covers the greater portion of the ground-floor, became the most
cosmopolitan rallying-point in London.&nbsp; For while the
atmosphere of the place attracted Continental visitors of all
nationalities, the quality of both the viands and wine, with the
excellence of the cooking and service, soon made it a favourite
resort of self-respecting Englishmen.&nbsp; Among the illustrious
exiles who from time to time have sipped coffee over its
domino-tables were Pilotel, the artist, who had left Paris after
the Commune.&nbsp; Under that extraordinary form of misgovernment
Pilotel had been Minister of Fine Arts.&nbsp; In London he
discovered his <i>m&eacute;tier</i> in designing models for the
Court milliners, and fashion-plates for the ladies&rsquo;
newspapers.&nbsp; A ribald wag once nicknamed him &ldquo;the
waister,&rdquo; employing that word, not in any derogatory sense,
but as a tribute to the wasp-like proportions with which the
great big man could endow a woman&rsquo;s bodice.</p>
<p>Boulanger has waxed voluble over his fortunes in this Regent
Street refuge.&nbsp; And here the notorious Esterh&aacute;zy, <a
name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 253</span>in later
days, has consoled himself in exile, his moments soothed by the
adulation of a female admirer.&nbsp; Here I have sat with Fred
Sandys, the artist, while he has discussed politics from the
Conservative point of view with Michael Davitt, the Nationalist,
the only Irish politician I ever met who gave me the idea that he
believed all he said.&nbsp; It all comes back to me&mdash;the
rattle of the dominoes on the marble slabs, the air charged with
the blue, acrid smoke from a hundred cigarettes, the quick
transit of the white-aproned waiters, the pungent odour of the
<i>caf&eacute; noir</i>, the flow of conversational chatter in
half a dozen languages, the <i>froufrou</i> of the passing skirt,
the flash of dark eyes, the smile on vermilion lips, the
high-pitched laugh over some picture in <i>Le Petit Journal pour
Rire</i>, the general air of life and the joy of it.&nbsp; The
history of the cellar at this famous restaurant is one of the
romances of the wine trade, and would be out of place here.&nbsp;
But it may just be noted that, when the vineyards in the South of
France which had supplied the brandy grape were, in the
seventies, laid bare by the phylloxera, the proprietor had
provided for a shortage in the eighties; and when that shortage
made itself felt, Frenchmen willingly paid the three shillings
which were demanded then for a liqueur-glass of <i>fin
champagne</i>.</p>
<p>Verrey&rsquo;s, on the other side of Regent Street, I have
mentioned as the second West End establishment at which a French
dinner could be obtained in those gastronomically evil days which
preceded the great awakening.&nbsp; When I first knew
Verrey&rsquo;s, it was run by old George Krehl, a most
entertaining man of the old school.&nbsp; He was not a Parisian,
or, indeed, a Frenchman at all; but he had been educated in the
French methods, and his bisque was the most delicate to be
obtained in London.&nbsp; At the death of the old man the
restaurant descended to his son George, who has since died.&nbsp;
George the younger Krehl was a dog-fancier in rather a large way
of business.&nbsp; He ran a paper called <i>The Stock-keeper</i>,
devoted to the interests of the &ldquo;fancy.&rdquo;&nbsp; Krehl
the Younger introduced some new breeds to Society, among which
were the basset-hound and the schipperk&eacute;.</p>
<p>In old Krehl&rsquo;s time Tennyson resorted to the restaurant
<a name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 254</span>during
his visits to town.&nbsp; The poet took quite a fancy to the
proprietor, and Krehl preserved many souvenirs of the
poet&mdash;plans of battle drawn on backs of menu-cards, and
other trifles whereby Tennyson thought to make his meaning quite
clear to a foreign listener.</p>
<p>It was in the old Krehl&rsquo;s time that I received an
invitation to dine with an Australian magnate of British birth,
on a visit to the mother-country.&nbsp; The dinner was served in
what was then known as the Cameo Room, and the occasion became
memorable to me by reason of an acquaintanceship then made, which
was destined to ripen into a lasting friendship.&nbsp; It was in
this way.&nbsp; I found myself seated next to a clergyman.&nbsp;
The circumstance at first caused me to curse my luck, for I have
never taken much stock in parsons.&nbsp; But before we had got to
the fish I found that my neighbour was not at all of the class of
clergyman with whom, to that time, it had been my fortune to get
acquainted.&nbsp; He was a man of medium height, about fifty
years of age, broad-shouldered, and of portly figure.&nbsp; His
grey beard was trimmed and pointed, and he wore a
moustache.&nbsp; His name was Bachelor, and he was a gaol
chaplain.</p>
<p>At that time I discovered nothing of the life-work of the
individual sitting beside me; nor from himself did I ever hear
anything, save incidentally, of his services to his
generation&mdash;services never acknowledged, and services
sometimes resented and always neglected by the authorities.&nbsp;
I had beside me that night, in fact, one of those who, in their
own persons, illustrate the truth of Henry Taylor&rsquo;s
apothegm: &ldquo;The world knows nothing of its greatest
men.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here, at least, something may be recorded as a
memorial to him.&nbsp; And at the same time the narrative may be
enlivened by one or two of those stimulating recollections of
which he seemed to be an inexhaustible mine.&nbsp; I never sat
down to a dinner at which I enjoyed myself more.&nbsp; My new
friend was a man of the world, a gourmet, a fine judge of wine,
and withal a practical philanthropist, unresting, untiring, and
undespairing.</p>
<p>Bachelor, after his ordination, went out to Australia as
chaplain to the first Bishop of Tasmania.&nbsp; He passed from
that position into the more active situation of chaplain to <a
name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 255</span>the penal
settlement there.&nbsp; From the beginning he took a strong human
interest in his &ldquo;parishioners,&rdquo; and he set to work in
the grim employment unhampered by traditions or instructions, or
preconceived notions of any sort.&nbsp; From the very start, his
theory was that the men to whom he had now become ghostly adviser
differed from those outside the settlement chiefly in the fact
that they had been found out.&nbsp; Of course he differentiated
the material with which he had to deal.&nbsp; This the Governor
of the settlement discovered during his first interview with the
new &ldquo;sky-pilot.&rdquo;&nbsp; The conversation between them
at length turned on the question of a servant for his
reverence&mdash;a menial who had, of course, been selected from
among the convicts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve chosen a first-rate chap for you,&rdquo;
said the Governor.&nbsp; &ldquo;Capital cook, good valet, nice
quiet manner, talks French like a native, and can mend your linen
like a needlewoman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he in for?&rdquo; inquired Bachelor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgery,&rdquo; replied the Governor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you let me have a murderer?&rdquo;
inquired the new chaplain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you like,&rdquo; replied the Governor, shrugging his
shoulders, and regarding the new settler as a man suffering from
a loose tile or so; and a murderer whose domestic accomplishments
fitted him for the post was duly allotted to the parson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he said, in relating the circumstance,
&ldquo;I counted on the fellow&rsquo;s gratitude; and I counted
right.&nbsp; The chances of a murderer obtaining the position
were about a million to one; and this fellow, knowing that fact,
exhibited a dog&rsquo;s fidelity, a woman&rsquo;s solicitude, and
the devotion of a fanatic to my person.&nbsp; He would at any
moment have given his life to save mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shortly after Bachelor arrived in Tasmania with its first
Bishop, his lordship sent out an invitation to the &ldquo;leading
citizens,&rdquo; asking them to a reception at the
&ldquo;palace.&rdquo;&nbsp; The day after the invitations went
out, the editor and proprietor of a newspaper in Tasmania called
at the &ldquo;palace,&rdquo; and demanded to see the new
prelate.&nbsp; Now, this particular owner and conductor of an
organ of public opinion kept his property going by a <a
name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 256</span>systematic
levying of blackmail&mdash;an easy and lucrative game in those
early days; for very few of the &ldquo;new rich&rdquo; in
Tasmania would care to have questions publicly asked about their
origin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you grow your own hemp?&rdquo; asked
Charles Lamb of his Australian correspondent.&nbsp; I need not
labour a point which is still sore in Tasmania.&nbsp; The Bishop
declined to see the caller.&nbsp; Bachelor, as his chaplain, was
deputed to conduct the interview.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the editor and proprietor of a newspaper in
Tasmania, and I want to know why I&rsquo;m not invited to the
Bishop&rsquo;s tea-fight?&rdquo; said the truculent visitor,
dashing <i>in medias res</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In your place I should accept the situation.&nbsp; I
should not probe after reasons,&rdquo; answered the chaplain with
characteristic suavity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gammon, parson!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got to know.&nbsp;
See?&nbsp; An&rsquo; if you don&rsquo;t tell me now, I&rsquo;ll
repeat the question in the columns of my paper!&rdquo; exclaimed
this Australasian <i>litt&eacute;rateur</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds rather like a threat, don&rsquo;t you
think?&rdquo; observed Bachelor, with perfect temper; &ldquo;and,
if you <i>will</i> have it, I think I may now give you his
lordship&rsquo;s reason for declining to invite you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let her go!&rdquo; said the editor encouragingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Bishop&rsquo;s reason for omitting your name is
simply this: that, in the old country, a man conducting a paper
on your lines would be considered outside the social
pale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The editor laughed uproariously.&nbsp; When he had recovered
his breath, he answered in these remarkable words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Innercent lambs!&nbsp; Outside the social pale,
hey!&nbsp; Lookye here, parson!&nbsp; You jest tell his lordship
from me that, <i>in Tasmania</i>, <i>no man is outside the social
pale&mdash;until he&rsquo;s hanged</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Sydney once it became the duty of Bachelor to see a
well-known man out of the world through the trap of a
gallows.&nbsp; Captain Knatchbull, a cadet of an old Kentish
family, had been, while in command of one of H.M.&rsquo;s ships,
guilty of an offence against the civil law, for which he was
tried and transported.&nbsp; He escaped from the convict
settlement, and turned up in Sydney half mad with exposure and
starvation.&nbsp; In the Bush he had probably perpetrated a crime
which was <a name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
257</span>never laid to his charge, for he had got rid of his
convict garb, and appeared in New South Wales fully attired in
the clothes of a victim who was probably done to death before
parting with them.&nbsp; The desperate man entered a
baker&rsquo;s shop in a back street.&nbsp; The shop was
empty.&nbsp; The man stretched his arm over the counter, and
pulled out the till.&nbsp; The woman owning the shop suddenly
appeared on the scene, and caught hold of the marauder&rsquo;s
wrist, screaming the while for assistance.&nbsp; Knatchbull flung
himself free, picked up the bread-knife from the counter, and
silenced the poor woman for ever.&nbsp; He was caught
red-handed.&nbsp; He was brought to trial, when the prosecuting
counsel was Robert Lowe, destined for future fame in England,
where he was to be Chancellor of the Exchequer and a peer of the
realm.&nbsp; On the scaffold he was attended by Bachelor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there any last word you would like to say?&rdquo;
whispered the chaplain in his ear.</p>
<p>Knatchbull looked up, cast a critical eye over the ghastly
apparatus, and, nodding his head in the direction of a defect,
said, with the utmost composure:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; <i>There&rsquo;s a kink in that
rope</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In another second his lifeless body was swinging at the end of
the incriminated hemp.&nbsp; He afforded, then, did Captain
Knatchbull, the supreme instance of &ldquo;the ruling passion
strong in death.&rdquo;&nbsp; He must pay the extreme penalty,
but he had respectfully suggested that the execution should be
ship-shape.</p>
<p>When he returned to England, Bachelor was appointed to
Dartmoor.&nbsp; While he was abroad he could only get at the Home
Office by means of a correspondence.&nbsp; Now he would be able
to pay personal visits to the high officials in Whitehall during
his holidays.&nbsp; No man ever made himself a greater nuisance
to a Department in the sacred cause of humanity than did
Bachelor.&nbsp; But humanity is a mere unofficial generality with
which Whitehall has nothing whatever to do.&nbsp; He bombarded
permanent officials, and he obtained introductions to successive
Home Secretaries with a view of effecting some amelioration in
the condition of the convict.&nbsp; When, by his own personal
influence with <a name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
258</span>the prisoners at Dartmoor, he was successful in
quelling the biggest and most elaborately organized mutiny known
up to that time, he became no more of a <i>persona grata</i> than
he had been before the outbreak.&nbsp; Officially he was merely
the gaol chaplain.&nbsp; It was not the business of the
Department to discover that they were dealing, not only with a
humanitarian, but with a man who had forgotten more criminology
than all the outsiders who write so glibly on the subject in
journals and magazines had ever known.</p>
<p>I at once confess that Bachelor was not attracted to me at
this dinner at Verrey&rsquo;s by any qualities of my own.&nbsp;
He understood that I was on the Press, and he always endeavoured
to create an interest in his views among pressmen whom he
met.&nbsp; For some time he had urged on the Home Office the
necessity there existed for supplying prisoners with a
newspaper.&nbsp; His theory, founded upon years of intelligent
observation, was that under our prison system a man becomes
either abnormally ingenious or abnormally bestial.&nbsp; And he
held that nothing except literature could successfully divert and
dissipate ideas which were likely to become obsessions; and that
the most interesting literature would be news&mdash;very
carefully edited, of course&mdash;of the outer world.&nbsp;
American officials are not so hidebound as the home-made article;
and the idea of my friend, neglected and contemned in England,
was welcomed and adopted in the United States, where the
principal penitentiaries now run their own newspapers.</p>
<p>We worked together subsequently at this notion of a gaol
journal, and I got out a &ldquo;dummy&rdquo; which showed pretty
fully what the proposed organ should be.&nbsp; At the Home Office
the science of circumlocution is better understood than in any
other Department in Whitehall.&nbsp; There was voluminous
correspondence, meaning much on the part of the parson, meaning
little more than a lavish waste of the tax-payer&rsquo;s stiff
stationery to the Home Office.&nbsp; Other ardent souls would
have sunk under the continuous disappointments, delays,
shufflings, impertinences, and utter indifference, of the Office;
but Bachelor&rsquo;s was not a nature to sink under
anything.&nbsp; He was a man of the world; his sympathy with his
incarcerated parish did not stand in <a name="page259"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 259</span>the way of his own reasonable
pleasures.&nbsp; So he kept on pegging away at Home Secretary
after Home Secretary, always hopeful, cheerful,
<i>d&eacute;bonnaire</i>.&nbsp; At last his reward came.&nbsp; A
large parcel of monthly magazines of the <i>Leisure Hour</i> and
<i>Good Words</i> type was delivered at his house, with a
communication from the Home Secretary.&nbsp; The chaplain was
requested to go through the bundle, and select such of the
publications as, in his opinion, might be usefully circulated
among prisoners.</p>
<p>Had such an act of brutal cynicism been played on the average
man, he would have probably pitched the periodicals into the
dustbin, and ceased to interest himself in the unfortunate
creatures for whom he struggled in vain.&nbsp; But Bachelor had a
finer temper than the average man.&nbsp; He reflected that a few
crumbs are better than no bread at all.&nbsp; He congratulated
himself that he had obtained some concession&mdash;small though
it was&mdash;for those whose cause he had been fighting through
weary years.&nbsp; He sat down before the bundle, conscientiously
read through every magazine contained in it, and made his
selection of publications deemed to be &ldquo;suitable&rdquo;
under the very strict and elaborate instructions laid down by the
Office in the covering letter.</p>
<p>And so it happens that the Cameo Room in Verrey&rsquo;s became
always associated in my mind with convicts and their
champion.&nbsp; In those days a dinner served there was the last
word in modern luxury.&nbsp; A big chandelier with the hundred
pendent crystals hung from the centre of the ceiling.&nbsp; In
mid-Victorian days the chandelier, with its prismatic glass
pendants, was regarded as the most swagger thing in the
decoration of a saloon.&nbsp; Candles guttered under their red
shades, science not having as yet supplied the simple preventive
contrivance.&nbsp; The dinner was beyond cavil or
criticism.&nbsp; The contents of the cellar had been carefully
selected, and its temperature was religiously observed and
maintained.&nbsp; But the conditions attendant . . .&nbsp; As the
wheels of my taxi turn from the rattle of the Strand and run
silent over the rubber pavement on the courtyard of the Savoy, I
recognize how far, in some matters, we have travelled in a very
few years.</p>

260</span>CHAPTER XVII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">BOOKIES AND OTHER WILD-FOWL</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Members</span> of the literary staff of a
newspaper were, in the far-off and half-forgotten days, deputed
to write graphic descriptions of what are known as &ldquo;the
classic events&rdquo; of the turf.&nbsp; A big newspaper would
send as many as three special correspondents to &ldquo;do&rdquo;
the Derby.&nbsp; One correspondent devoted himself to the journey
down by road, a second described the journey by rail, and a third
gave an animated pen-sketch of the course.&nbsp; Indeed, some
journals whose motto was &ldquo;Thorough,&rdquo; were accustomed
to send a man to potter about the course the night before the
Derby&mdash;a writer with the James Greenwood touch, who might be
depended upon for a dramatic and humorous column and a half.</p>
<p>Ascot and Goodwood were the other &ldquo;classic events&rdquo;
to which the descriptive writer would be despatched.&nbsp;
Goodwood was always supposed to necessitate the employment of
certain venerable clich&eacute;s.&nbsp; And very old journalists
used, therefore, to consider it a great privilege to be sent to
that aristocratic meeting.&nbsp; Ascot naturally gave
considerable scope to the journalist who flattered himself on an
intimate knowledge of Society with a capital
&ldquo;S.&rdquo;&nbsp; For a whole delirious week he never left
Society.&nbsp; He watched its menials depart for the Thames
Valley on the Sunday before the meeting, and on the Sunday after
he was pretty certain to turn up at Boulter&rsquo;s Lock, where
some representative ornaments of Society should be on view.</p>
<p>Out of all the men on the daily Press who have been
commissioned to attend race-meetings as descriptive writers, I
have never known one who became a victim of the betting <a
name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
261</span>habit.&nbsp; Yet I have known several sub-editors whose
functions did not take them near a race-course, but whose real
business in life seemed to be betting, their sub-editing being
regarded as a temporary means of obtaining the original stake
which, some day, was to supply the foundation of a fortune.&nbsp;
Members of the sporting Press were betting men to a scribe.&nbsp;
And so it happened that, no matter what the salary of a writer on
the sporting Press might be, he was always in financial
difficulties.&nbsp; If these gentlemen, presumably &ldquo;in the
know,&rdquo; found the game unprofitable, what chance should
there be, I reflected, for an outsider?&nbsp; Nevertheless, and
holding these virtuous views, I have from time to time fallen
from grace.&nbsp; These occasional lapses have usually followed a
casual bet where the odds have been long and the
&ldquo;tip&rdquo; has &ldquo;come off.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
eventually the bookies have always got their own back
again&mdash;and a bit over and above.</p>
<p>This moralizing strain reminds me of the appearance of Robert
Buchanan, the poet, as a backer of horses.&nbsp; Some graceless
men were inclined to regard the contact of Buchanan with the Ring
as something in the nature of a joke.&nbsp; To me it constituted
a pitiful and sordid tragedy.&nbsp; Buchanan was another of those
men who always wanted money, and who was ever on the lookout for
some easy way of getting it.&nbsp; I do not know who it was that
introduced him to the turf as a likely method of adding to his
resources.&nbsp; But I should not care to be the man with that
sin on my soul.&nbsp; If Buchanan knew a horse from a cow, it was
about as much as he knew.&nbsp; As to the significance of the
weights in a handicap he was entirely ignorant.&nbsp; He had got
into his head that by luck and good advice large sums might be
made out of the Ring.&nbsp; About twenty years ago I first came
across him while he was thus engaged.&nbsp; It was at Epsom the
day after the Derby.&nbsp; The grand-stand was but sparsely
inhabited.&nbsp; In the interval between the last race and the
last but one, I saw Buchanan coming across the course.&nbsp; I
went down to meet him.&nbsp; He was in a flurried and excited
condition.&nbsp; He had experienced a &ldquo;rotten&rdquo;
day.&nbsp; Nor was I surprised when he proceeded to explain to me
his <i>modus operandi</i>.&nbsp; It was this:</p>
<p><a name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 262</span>He
had engaged the services of an infallible tipster.&nbsp; This
infallible young person I afterwards discovered to be one of the
notorious &ldquo;boys&rdquo; of the American Bar of the
Criterion, the rendezvous from which the hero of Ardlamont, it
will be recollected, chose his associates.&nbsp; For himself and
this egregious seer he had taken rooms for the week at the Sun in
Kingston, the pair of them driving over to the course each
morning in an open landau.&nbsp; As he eagerly explained to me
the unsuspected occurrences which had upset the calculations of
his adviser, and within how very little he came of pulling off
some uncommonly good things, I was profoundly moved.&nbsp; Here
was the author of a work of fiction of the quality of &ldquo;God
and the Man,&rdquo; and of poems like &ldquo;Fra Giacomo,&rdquo;
plunging on a race-course with the most sordid motives and with
the most ridiculous equipment, and associating with an adviser
with whom no self-respecting sportsman would care to be seen
talking.</p>
<p>He had a very strong tip for the next race, and he was anxious
that I should share in any good fortune that might result from
backing it.&nbsp; I looked at my card.&nbsp; Among the starters I
saw a horse named Tandragee.&nbsp; I said, half in earnest, that,
if I had a bet at all, I should back Tandragee.&nbsp; He inquired
very anxiously whether I had heard anything.&nbsp; I assured him
that I knew nothing whatever, but that the animal bore the name
of &ldquo;Kim&rdquo; Mandeville&rsquo;s place in Ireland.&nbsp;
Buchanan looked at me reproachfully, as if to suggest that I was
treating in a spirit of levity a very serious, and even tragic,
business.&nbsp; I made inquiries about Tandragee, and a member of
Tattersall&rsquo;s ring laid me ten to one against it.&nbsp; My
horse won easily, and Buchanan&rsquo;s &ldquo;certainty,&rdquo;
about which he had only got three to one, was not placed.</p>
<p>With the most ordinary care Robert Buchanan should have
acquired a nice little fortune.&nbsp; As it was, he lived in a
series of financial straits, and when he paid the debt of nature
he left all his other debts undischarged.</p>
<p>My recollections of race-meetings will always be dominated by
the figure of Caroline, Duchess of Montrose.&nbsp; I was young
and impressionable when I first saw this formidable <i>grande
dame</i>.&nbsp; I first beheld her on the lawn at Goodwood.&nbsp;
She <a name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 263</span>was
accompanied by her husband, Mr. Sterling Crauford, one of the
very best and most aristocratic of racing men.&nbsp; Her Grace
had a really wonderful vocabulary.&nbsp; She could have debated a
point with a bargee starting at even weights.&nbsp; Only once was
she talked down.&nbsp; That was by the Thersites of the outer
ring&mdash;Dick Dunn.&nbsp; This was an Homeric encounter.&nbsp;
Rich and rare were the gems in Dick Dunn&rsquo;s armoury of
invective.&nbsp; While the battle lasted, it was a veritable
interchange of torpedoes.&nbsp; But the vituperative book-maker
won, and the Duchess burst into tears.</p>
<p>Caroline, Duchess of Montrose, was once in a towering rage
over the defeat of one of her husband&rsquo;s horses, which she
had backed heavily, and, as was her wont, she was violently
abusing the unhappy boy who had ridden.&nbsp; I rather think it
was little Gallon, but am not sure.&nbsp; &ldquo;You young
rascal!&rdquo; exclaimed the angry Duchess, &ldquo;did I not tell
you to get through and come right away before reaching the
bend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, your Grace, you did,&rdquo; blubbered the boy;
&ldquo;b-b-b-but I couldn&rsquo;t come without the
horse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Sterling Crauford died, the Duchess selected as her third
husband a youth who might have been her grandson.</p>
<p>I have just mentioned Dick Dunn, the bookmaker.&nbsp; This
redoubtable penciller was of Irish nationality, his real name
being O&rsquo;Donoghue.&nbsp; He was an extremely good-looking,
well-set-up fellow, and, casually encountered, one would never
have believed him capable of the heights and depths of
picturesque objurgation to which he rose and sank.&nbsp; But he
was really a good-natured chap, with a fund of quaint and
characteristic humour.&nbsp; I once attended a smoking-concert
promoted at Hampton for a charitable purpose, at which Dick Dunn
had been asked to preside.&nbsp; Things went very well until a
local celebrity&mdash;an octogenarian&mdash;was called upon to
sing.&nbsp; The old man began to intone a very long ballad in
very slow time.&nbsp; The audience were getting tired, and the
chairman was getting very fidgety.&nbsp; At last the vocalist
gave the chairman his opportunity.&nbsp; He was trolling out a
fresh verse commencing with the two lines:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He went into a barber&rsquo;s shop,<br />
There for to get him shaved.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
264</span>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; roared out Dunn, bringing his
hammer sharply down on the table, &ldquo;what do you suppose he
<i>would</i> go in for&mdash;<i>to buy onions</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The audience broke into laughter, and the abashed warbler sat
down.</p>
<p>They tell me that the present is an uncommonly bad time for
bookmakers.&nbsp; At the Albert and Victoria they are betting
with each other&mdash;a tame business, and comparable only (as
one of the fraternity recently put it to me) to &ldquo;kissing
one&rsquo;s sister.&rdquo;&nbsp; The occupation of &ldquo;Oh,
yell, oh!&rdquo; is gone.&nbsp; But in my early Press days he
flourished like a green bay-tree.&nbsp; In the early seventies
Steele and Peach of Sheffield were the magnates of the
Ring.&nbsp; Steele was a big, heavy-faced, sleepy-looking
man.&nbsp; He commenced his commercial career by hawking fish
through the streets on a barrow.&nbsp; Peach, who was far smarter
in appearance, was of equally low origin.&nbsp; The two
leviathans of the Ring were closely related by marriage, and
ended up by becoming owners of one of the richest steel-works in
Sheffield.</p>
<p>I can well remember Olney of Manchester and Steve Mundell of
Durham.&nbsp; Olney was a stout, white-haired, red-faced man, who
would have been a little one but for the extra weight in fat he
carried.&nbsp; He was grumpy, but straight, and his prices were
simply awful.&nbsp; Mundell was known as &ldquo;the Durham
Ox.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was, as his sobriquet may suggest, a big,
beefy man.&nbsp; His Durham acquaintances were very proud of him;
and, indeed, he was not half a bad sort.&nbsp; He was fond of
coursing, and kept a few greyhounds of his own.</p>
<p>Our old friend the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, writing about some
meeting in a flamboyant style, indulged in an allusion to
&ldquo;the genteel pencillers in the velvet
costumes.&rdquo;&nbsp; This chance allusion was the making of
Fred Fraser.&nbsp; He and his brother&mdash;who clerked for
him&mdash;always appeared dressed in brown velvet coats, cord
breeches, jack-boots, and sombreros.&nbsp; At one time he ran a
few horses, but his favourite sport was fishing, and his record
exhibition of objurgation was given in connection with the
pursuit of this comparatively innocent pastime.&nbsp; This was at
Staines.&nbsp; He had left <a name="page265"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 265</span>his line in the water while he went
into the town.&nbsp; During his absence a friend fastened a dried
haddock to his hook.&nbsp; On his return, the deluded man saw
that he had &ldquo;got a bite,&rdquo; and proceeded to
&ldquo;land.&rdquo;&nbsp; The &ldquo;air went blue for
miles&rdquo; as the outraged fisherman expressed his opinion of
the practical jokers who had tampered with his tackle.&nbsp; Mr.
Fraser was, indeed, a gentleman who should have benefited by an
extended experience of the silent system; and this he was shortly
to have.&nbsp; He was sentenced to a long term for a particularly
brutal outrage.&nbsp; And that was the end of &ldquo;the genteel
penciller&rdquo; so far as Society and the Turf are
concerned.</p>
<p>Billy Nicholls of Nottingham was a wealthy man and a
&ldquo;character.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was a member of the Town
Council of his native borough, and a rather good yarn used to be
told of his action in this capacity when a certain matter of
great local interest was brought up before the <i>Patres
Conscripti</i> of Nottingham.&nbsp; The burning question of
&ldquo;the town pump&rdquo; had come up in another shape.&nbsp;
Public opinion was divided as to whether or not a wall should be
built round the cemetery; and, as the municipal elections were at
hand, the members of the Council were also much &ldquo;vexed in
their righteous minds&rdquo; as to how they should vote on the
recommendation of the committee.&nbsp; It remained for Billy
Nicholls to settle the question by a speech which was brief, to
the point, and absolutely convincing:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Muster Mayor, Haldermen, an&rsquo; gen&rsquo;lemen
hall,&rdquo; he said, when he rose in his place,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s like this yer: the pore chaps inside
can&rsquo;t get out, and them what&rsquo;s outside don&rsquo;t
want to get in.&nbsp; So I says, &lsquo;No
wall.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And &ldquo;no wall&rdquo; it was.</p>
<p>Charlie Head was a bookie of a different type.&nbsp; He was
dapper, well dressed&mdash;in fact, a bit of a dandy.&nbsp; The
waxed ends of his moustache were a source of general joy to his
friends at a time when this mode of treating what Mr. Frank
Richardson would call &ldquo;face fungi&rdquo; was comparatively
neglected.&nbsp; I first met Head, not on the course, but at the
theatre.&nbsp; He was a devoted supporter of the drama, and it
was only reasonable that he should look to the drama to <a
name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 266</span>support
him.&nbsp; This it very generously did, when the Philharmonic in
Islington was turned into a theatre for the production of
&ldquo;Genevieve de Brabant,&rdquo; one of the most popular
examples of <i>opera bouffe</i> ever given in England.&nbsp; All
the town flocked lightly to the <i>terra incognita</i> to see
Emily Soldene in her bewitching cook&rsquo;s uniform, just as all
the town some years before had flocked to see Marie Wilton and
her clever company in the equally unknown little playhouse in
Tottenham Street.&nbsp; In his management of the Philharmonic
Theatre, at this very profitable period of its history, Head was
associated with Charles Morton&mdash;a gentleman whose name was
never connected with failure.</p>
<p>Tom King, the well-known champion of the prize ring, was also
making a book in the seventies.&nbsp; King was a splendid chap,
tall, and well set up as a guardsman.&nbsp; His nose was slightly
out of drawing&mdash;the result, no doubt, of a professional
misadventure.&nbsp; When he left the prize ring Tom cultivated a
beard and moustache, which were always carefully trimmed.&nbsp;
Anything more unlike a &ldquo;bruiser&rdquo; it would be
impossible to imagine.&nbsp; His &ldquo;book&rdquo; was not his
only source of income: he enjoyed large profits as a barge
owner.&nbsp; King was a remarkable raconteur, and had a
practically inexhaustible collection of yarns, none of them quite
suitable for spinning in pages intended for general
circulation.</p>
<p>Waterhouse was one of the best of his class.&nbsp; He was a
short, fat man, with a funny little <i>mouche</i> on his lower
lip.&nbsp; With the exception of this spot, his chubby face was
clean-shaven.&nbsp; He was a hot-tempered chap, but as straight
as a gun-barrel.&nbsp; He had made a hobby of pigeons, of which
he was a well-known and eminently successful exhibitor.&nbsp;
Waterhouse was commissioner for Lord Bradford&rsquo;s stable, and
won, I believe, a lot of money when Sir Hugo, at 40 to I, beat La
Fl&ecirc;che in the Derby of 1892&mdash;a date, I should
recollect, which lands me two years beyond the chronological
limits of these memoirs.</p>
<p>But, to my way of thinking, Charles Brewer was far and away
the best of the old bookmakers.&nbsp; He had his offices in
Charles Street, St. James&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He was joint owner with
Charles Blanton, the trainer of that famous racehorse, Robert the
<a name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
267</span>Devil.&nbsp; Thousands of the British public, as well
as the owners, were bitterly disappointed when Robert the Devil
failed to pull off the Derby in 1880.&nbsp; The race was won, it
will be remembered, by the Duke of Westminster&rsquo;s Bend
Or.&nbsp; I saw that exciting finish.&nbsp; It was lost to Robert
the Devil owing to the cock-sureness of Rossiter, the
jockey.&nbsp; He took matters far too easy, and was imprudent
enough to look over his shoulder at the psychological
moment.&nbsp; Archer, that king of riders, saw his advantage in a
flash, and caught his opponent at the post.</p>
<p>And a curious consideration, not altogether unconnected with
psychological ramifications, appeals to me here.&nbsp; When I
have been deputed to go to a race-meeting for the purpose of
making a column or so of descriptive &ldquo;copy,&rdquo; the Ring
has always presented itself to me as a modern Inferno packed with
raucous, foul-mouthed demons&mdash;rapacious, brutal,
sordid.&nbsp; Again and again have I reeled off impressionist
descriptions of what I conceived to be a very brutal
exhibition.&nbsp; Yet, in looking back to those old times, the
picture of the betting ring does not come back to me as a
complete and vivid impression.&nbsp; Faces gaze out at me one by
one, and they are all the faces of men who have made their last
settlement.&nbsp; One becomes more charitable with the passing of
the years, I suppose, and Time teaches us to differentiate.&nbsp;
I fail altogether now to recall the Ring as a raging, seething
pit.&nbsp; I only recall, with feelings not estranged, some of
its members whom I have known, and with whom I have done a little
business from time to time.&nbsp; Their manners may not have been
those of a Chesterfield, but their principles of commercial
morality were more commendable than those of the nobleman whose
&ldquo;Letters,&rdquo; according to honest Samuel Johnson,
inculcated the morals of a monkey and the manners of&mdash;well,
of something even less respectable than our simian ancestor.</p>
<p>But, having said so much in favour of the personal qualities
of certain members of the betting ring, and having admitted that
the transactions of the fraternity are as a rule honest and open,
I venture to suggest that the institution itself is capable of
considerable improvement&mdash;that, indeed, <a
name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 268</span>the time
has come when it might, with benefit to the community and to the
Government, be improved off the face of the earth.&nbsp; We are a
nation of hypocrites, and are governed by a series of Ministries
who play up to our hypocrisy.&nbsp; To certain phases of certain
subjects our Government elects to remain blind.&nbsp; By a
minority of our countrymen betting is set down as a sin.&nbsp;
This minority (many of whom make bets on the sly) has an
influence with those in power.&nbsp; Therefore the Government of
the day assumes that there is no such thing as wagering for money
over horse-racing.&nbsp; The bookmaker is a myth.&nbsp; In the
words of Mrs. Gamp, a Minister will tell you, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t believe there&rsquo;s no sich a person.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And yet what an income is waiting for that Chancellor of the
Exchequer who will possess the courage to disestablish the
betting ring by instituting the system of <i>Paris
Mutuels</i>!&nbsp; The &ldquo;sin&rdquo; of betting would not be
increased thereby, so that the moral minority should not be
perturbed.&nbsp; Absolute protection would be afforded to
backers, so that the public would be safeguarded and
gratified.&nbsp; And the income derivable from commission to the
Government would go far towards providing a new
<i>Dreadnought</i> every year, so that, in any event, the nation
must be a gainer.</p>
<p>Mr. Lloyd George might talk the matter over with
&lsquo;Dr.&rsquo; Clifford, Mr. Silvester Horne, and the
President of the Methodist Conference.&nbsp; The predominant
partner&mdash;Mr. John Redmond, to wit&mdash;would, I am
confident, give his consent to an experiment the object of which
would be to give some movement to treasuries which have long
since ceased to be &ldquo;flowing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I once spent some hours in the house of a bookmaker, and had
an opportunity of studying the penciller&rsquo;s
<i>m&eacute;nage</i>.&nbsp; I had often had a bet with Andy
Anderson.&nbsp; His prices were a trifle short, but he was an
agreeable man to do business with&mdash;jovial, good-tempered,
and amusing.&nbsp; After a day&rsquo;s racing at Hurst Park, he
overtook &ldquo;Boris&rdquo; of the <i>Referee</i> and myself,
and suggested a &ldquo;lift&rdquo; as far as
Surbiton&mdash;without consulting us as to whether or not
Surbiton was on our way home.&nbsp; &ldquo;Boris&rdquo;&mdash;who
in private life was Mr. Harry Bromhead&mdash;accepted the
invitation.&nbsp; We were given the <a name="page269"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 269</span>back seats on Andy&rsquo;s jobbed
landau and pair, the bookie and his clerk facing us, and his
&ldquo;runner&rdquo; sitting on the box.&nbsp; The carriage
eventually drew up at a detached house standing back from an
umbrageous front-garden in one of the most highly respectable
avenues in Surbiton.&nbsp; The spick-and-span appearance of the
fa&ccedil;ade of the &ldquo;desirable family residence&rdquo;
suggested the home of a prosperous stockbroker&mdash;a class of
sportsman then affecting the neighbourhood.&nbsp; Anderson got
out, followed by his guests.&nbsp; The landau bowled off with the
clerk and the &ldquo;runner&rdquo; aboard, and Andy effusively
invited us to enter.</p>
<p>We were shown into the drawing-room, where we found Mrs.
Anderson&mdash;a remarkably fine woman, with much of her
husband&rsquo;s easy good temper&mdash;petting a remarkably
uninteresting mongrel.&nbsp; Then occurred one of those incidents
which illustrated a strange boyish side of Andy&rsquo;s
character.&nbsp; Having formally introduced us to his wife, he
gazed at the dog on her lap with an expression of amazement and
admiration, and asked, with great seriousness:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you get that dog, my dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bought him off a man on the tow-path,&rdquo; replied
Mrs. Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you give?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five shillings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; exclaimed Andy,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ve had a better day on the tow-path than
I&rsquo;ve had on the course.&nbsp; Why, that dog is worth fifty
quid.&nbsp; You take great care of him, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What breed is he?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Anderson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a tripe-hound,&rdquo; answered Andy, without
moving a muscle, and still regarding the wretched animal with the
satisfied air of an expert.</p>
<p>Mrs. Anderson accepted the legend in deadly earnest.&nbsp; The
next day, as I afterwards heard, she went into Kingston,
purchased a silver collar with her name and address engraved
thereon, obtained a lead, and appeared every afternoon on the
promenade by the river with her priceless pet.&nbsp; When asked
about its pedigree by friends, she explained that she was obliged
to take great care of him, as he was a <a
name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
270</span>tripe-hound.&nbsp; It was Bessie Bellwood who
eventually &ldquo;gave the show away.&rdquo;&nbsp; Making a call
on Mrs. Anderson, and feeling a curiosity to ascertain why such a
woman should make a pet of such an entirely hopeless hybrid, she
asked about it, and received the usual reply, given with an air
of complacent pride in possession.&nbsp; Bessie&rsquo;s sense of
humour was keen, and her expression of it tumultuous.&nbsp; She
burst into a fit of irrepressible laughter.&nbsp; Explanations
ensued.&nbsp; The tripe-hound was disposed of, and relations
between Andy and his wife became somewhat strained.</p>
<p>From the drawing-room, furnished in the most crowded fashion
of Early Victorian period, we were conducted to the dining-room,
to have what just at that time was becoming known as &ldquo;a
bottle of the boy.&rdquo;&nbsp; Meeting with a bookmaker socially
always meant in those days a bottle of champagne.&nbsp; The
pencillers seemed to swim in it.&nbsp; It is different now.&nbsp;
The simple and less expensive whisky-and-soda is regarded by the
majority of the Ring as an excellent substitute for the
exhilarating vintages of Ay and &Eacute;pernay and
Grammont.&nbsp; In his own house Andy was the soul of
hospitality.&nbsp; He pressed us to remain to dinner.&nbsp; But
we both had duties in town.&nbsp; However, we sat listening to
his anecdotes and experiences for an hour or more.&nbsp; The most
surprising of his reminiscences was that he, Andy Anderson the
bookmaker, was the son of a Baptist minister!&nbsp; At first I
was inclined to rate the confession with the legend of the
tripe-hound, but the statement was one of fact.&nbsp; I commend
it to the consideration of Nonconformist Turf-haters; they can
take it either of two ways&mdash;as an inducement to regard
charitably a calling which provides fine openings for the bright
sons of Baptist ministers, or as an argument in favour of the
<i>Paris Mutuels</i>, whereby the temptation to become bookmakers
would be for ever removed from the precocious progeny of the
&ldquo;unco&rsquo; guid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mention of Bromhead naturally reminds me of the paper
which he served so well for so many years.&nbsp; The
<i>Referee</i> was established by Henry Sampson some few yew
after Mr. Corlett found the continuous-paragraph method so sudden
and so triumphant a success.&nbsp; But the founders <a
name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 271</span>of the new
paper, while appreciating the main reason of their rival&rsquo;s
success, were not slow to observe the departments in which the
older paper was &ldquo;slack.&rdquo;&nbsp; So from the start the
<i>Referee</i> gave a proper attention to arrangement of contents
and sub-editing.&nbsp; And the paper is still distinguished for
its care in these respects.&nbsp; In a former chapter I have
alluded sympathetically to the fact that death has dogged the
footsteps of Mr. Corlett&rsquo;s staff.&nbsp; The <i>Referee</i>
has a more fortunate record.&nbsp; Of the original staff of the
<i>Referee</i>, four members are still living and working.&nbsp;
These are Mr. Richard Butler, Mr. H. Chance Newton, Mr. Edwards,
and Mr. George R. Sims.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Handbook&rdquo; on the
first page has of recent years become a valued feature.&nbsp; The
best of the series was contributed by the patient and reflective
Nesbit, of the <i>Times</i>.&nbsp; He was followed by Christie
Murray.&nbsp; The present writer is Mr. Arnold White, whose range
is more limited than that of his predecessors.&nbsp; But he
strikes the patriotic note all the time.&nbsp; And the expression
of his patriotism never rings false.</p>
<p>In the seventies the <i>doyen</i> of the racing Press was
Comyns Cole, of the <i>Times</i> and the <i>Field</i>.&nbsp; In
whatever society he might be found Cole was always a striking
personality.&nbsp; He was not only an accomplished journalist,
but he was a typical English gentleman of the school even then
becoming regarded as &ldquo;old.&rdquo;&nbsp; He possessed all
the gracious courtesy of a more formal age.&nbsp; At the time
when I made his acquaintance he was well over sixty, but he was
erect in carriage, slim in figure, always carefully dressed to
suit the occasion, and impartially polite to Dukes and
jockeys.&nbsp; His carefully-cultured grey moustache gave him
something of a military appearance.&nbsp; His greatest charm was,
perhaps, in a voice of unusual sweetness.&nbsp; And on the Turf
he was liked and respected by everybody, high and low.&nbsp; Not
merely was Cole a gentleman in thought and act, but he spoke and
wrote like one.&nbsp; He could never have become contaminated by
the baleful influences of the Press-room.</p>
<p>In my early days there were a lot of small race-meetings in
the vicinity of London which have ceased to exist, their
suppression or extinction, owing to natural causes, being a <a
name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
272</span>circumstance on which Society may be greatly
congratulated.&nbsp; Of these, Hampton was one of the most
notorious.&nbsp; It was a great Cockney carnival, and was held on
the ground over which Hurst Park now stretches.&nbsp; All the
costers of the East End drove down to this event on their
&ldquo;flying bedsteads,&rdquo; in the shafts of which
conveyances were harnessed their &ldquo;mokes.&rdquo;&nbsp; On
one side of the bedstead, with legs hanging over the front, was
the coster, urging his &ldquo;moke&rdquo; with comic
blasphemies.&nbsp; On the other side sat his &ldquo;dona,&rdquo;
all hat and feathers, howling snatches of the music-hall songs of
the moment, and in the intervals plying her &ldquo;bloke&rdquo;
with beer.&nbsp; All the pickpockets, welchers, thimble-riggers,
and confidence-tricksters of the Metropolis turned up at this
event, and nowhere else would you be likely to come across scenes
of more unbridled blackguardism.&nbsp; The inhabitants of
Hampton&mdash;standing as it does on one of the prettiest of the
nearer reaches of the Thames&mdash;were naturally incensed by the
annual Saturnalia.</p>
<p>Not all those who were attracted to the meeting came down for
the sport.&nbsp; Many of them hired skiffs and went on the
water.&nbsp; These greatly daring adventurers had but the most
rudimentary use of the sculls, and their immunity from accident
can only be traced to that watchful Providence which is believed
to look after drunken men and infants.&nbsp; On one occasion I
happened during these races to be at Hampton, which is, of
course, on the other side of the river.&nbsp; I there saw a
rather cranky skiff let out by a local boat-owner to a party of a
dozen happy Cockneys, male and female of their kind, not one of
whom could row and few of whom could swim.&nbsp; As they
zigzagged their way to midstream, I thought it my duty to
remonstrate with the boat-owner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have let a boat to that lot:
they&rsquo;re sure to capsize,&rdquo; I ventured to suggest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s orright, guv&rsquo;nor,&rdquo; answered the
man cheerily; &ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;ve &rsquo;ad a quid
deposit</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Funny thing, the point of view.&nbsp; I was solicitous about
the safety of the Cockney excursionists.&nbsp; My boat-hiring
friend could only imagine that I was anxious lest his skiff <a
name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 273</span>should come
to grief, and was happy to assure me that he had secured himself
against all possible loss!</p>
<p>At Kingsbury there was another of these classic events.&nbsp;
It was never my proud privilege to witness the racing at
Kingsbury; but the suppression of that meeting was a
never-ceasing cause of regret to Warner, of the Welsh Harp,
Hendon.&nbsp; I made the acquaintance of that illustrious man
when I was sent down to interview Mrs. Girling on the part of a
daily paper &ldquo;whose name shall be nameless,&rdquo; as a
villain of melodrama once put it.&nbsp; The name of Mrs. Girling,
I imagine, will call up no memories in the present
generation.&nbsp; The poor lady, although she made a wonderful
commotion in her time, has failed to write her name with any
legibility on the page of history.</p>
<p>Mrs. Girling, then, was the president, or high-priestess, or
boss of the Shaker community, which at one time thought to
establish itself in the country of a hundred religions and one
sauce.&nbsp; Notwithstanding all that has been alleged to the
contrary, the English still possess a certain sense of humour,
and their knowledge of the new sect was chiefly derived from the
writings of Artemus Ward, who had devoted a chapter of &ldquo;His
Book&rdquo; to the more salient eccentricities of the
Shakers.&nbsp; One of the sect he described as looking like
&ldquo;a last year&rsquo;s bean-pole dressed in a long
meal-bag.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The corybantic religionists who had come across the Atlantic
with Mrs. Girling in the pious hope of converting the islanders
had been evicted from their quarters in the New Forest, and had
encamped on, and under, the grandstand on the Kingsbury
racecourse.&nbsp; The expulsion of the Shakers from their
Hampshire Eden became the subject of a great deal of comment in
the Press, and Warner, who was above all else a showman, at once
saw his way to make some money out of the eccentric exiles from
the States.&nbsp; So he philanthropically offered the evicted
evangelists such shelter as the Kingsbury grand-stand
afforded.&nbsp; Mrs. Girling was grateful.&nbsp; Half London
flocked to Hendon to inspect the high-priestess and her faithful
following of Latter-Day Saints, and, incidentally, to partake of
refreshments at the <a name="page274"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 274</span>Welsh Harp.&nbsp; It was on my way
home after my interview with Mrs. Girling that I made the
acquaintance of Mr. Warner himself.&nbsp; He was a large, jovial,
effusive person&mdash;quite the typical Boniface, in fact.&nbsp;
I was about to write &ldquo;the typical John Bull,&rdquo; when I
recollected that the national nickname has acquired associations
which render it&mdash;well, not quite typical.</p>
<p>Warner appeared to spend most of his time sitting in a wooden
armchair of Brobdingnagian proportions.&nbsp; When in an
anecdotal or reminiscent mood, he could be extremely
entertaining.&nbsp; One of his reminiscences may be worth
repeating.&nbsp; The Welsh Harp pleasure-grounds had become a
favourite arena for the managers of Sunday-school treats and high
jinks of a similar character.&nbsp; During the summer months
thousands of children were carted down from the lanes and alleys
of the town to pick daisies in Warner&rsquo;s fields, to wander
by the margin of Warner&rsquo;s lake, and to &ldquo;wolf&rdquo;
Warner&rsquo;s buns and ginger-beer amid delightfully rural
surroundings.&nbsp; Consternation, therefore, seized this
particular section of Society when there appeared in the papers
the report that the pet bear of the Welsh Harp had escaped from
its den, and had taken refuge in some neighbouring thicket.&nbsp;
In vain did Warner write solemn disclaimers to the daily
papers.&nbsp; His pathetic denials of the existence of any bear
on the estate were received with frigid scepticism.&nbsp; The
rumour had been sown broadcast, and had taken root.&nbsp; The
crop was accepted as first-class fact.&nbsp; The more strongly
did Warner protest, the more picturesque became the newspaper
reports of the bear-hunt, the methods of the trackers, and their
failure to trap their quarry.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the outlook was becoming serious for the owner of
the famous pleasaunce.&nbsp; Every post brought the poor man
letters from the promoters of bean-feasts and Sunday-school
treats cancelling their dates.&nbsp; In moments of desperation
the brain sometimes becomes superactive.&nbsp; At such a moment
Warner was the subject of an inspiration, or, as he himself put
it, &ldquo;an &rsquo;appy thought struck him.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
drove off to Jamrach&rsquo;s, the famous dealers in wild animals,
in the Ratcliff Highway, and there he purchased the cheapest <a
name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 275</span>bear in the
market.&nbsp; The brute was taken to the Welsh Harp in a van and
at dead of night.&nbsp; The following morning the animal was
found tied up to a tree in the grounds, and Warner triumphantly
issued to the Press a purely imaginary account of its pursuit and
capture.&nbsp; The consequences of the ruse were satisfactory all
round.&nbsp; Nobody seemed to remember anything at all of
Warner&rsquo;s pathetic denials of the existence of a bear.&nbsp;
The accuracy of the Press reporters was vindicated, and the
publication of Warner&rsquo;s circumstantial account of the chase
and capture attracted thousands of sightseers to the Welsh
Harp&mdash;most of them thirsty.&nbsp; In a few days the
ingenious designer of this public deception was able to recoup
himself for the losses sustained owing to the alleged ravages of
an ursine &ldquo;Mrs. Harris&rdquo; by the production of a real
bear&mdash;a hired, harmless, and humiliated brute.</p>
<p>Time has been kind to the old Welsh Harp, and I fervently hope
that the day is far distant ere even a garden city shall be
established by the shores of the wonderful lake whereon the
Cockney sailed and fished in the summer, and skated&mdash;and was
periodically immersed&mdash;in the winter months.&nbsp; For a
little while at least its memory will be kept green by
Chevalier&rsquo;s &ldquo;Coster&rsquo;s Serenade&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t forgotten yet that night in
May<br />
Dahn at the Welsh &rsquo;Arp, which is &rsquo;Endon way?<br />
<i>You</i> fancied winkles and a pot of tea;<br />
&lsquo;Four &rsquo;alf,&rsquo; I murmured, &lsquo;&rsquo;s good
enough for <i>me</i>.<br />
Give me a word of &rsquo;ope that I may win.&rsquo;<br />
You prods me gently with the winkle pin.<br />
We was as &rsquo;appy as could be that day<br />
Dahn at the Welsh &rsquo;Arp, which is &rsquo;Endon
way.&rdquo;</p>

276</span>CHAPTER XVIII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">OLLA PODRIDA</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Two</span> American managers had made
themselves very well known to the Street of Adventure in the
early eighties.&nbsp; It was before the advent of the mighty
Frohman and other engineers of the great combine.&nbsp; The one
was known as &ldquo;Johnny&rdquo; Rogers, and the other was W. W.
Kelly.&nbsp; The last-named gentleman must be, I imagine, still
to the fore, for during the last General Election I visited two
provincial centres, and saw, peeling from the walls of each, the
mammoth posters of that wonderful Napoleonic melodrama &ldquo;A
Royal Divorce.&rdquo;&nbsp; I wonder whether, if the spirit of my
old friend, W. G. Wills, revisited these &ldquo;glimpses of the
moon,&rdquo; he would recognize his workmanship and marvel at
sight of the crowds it still attracts.</p>
<p>Kelly was a tall, florid man, flamboyant in manner, and gifted
with an eloquence which was never ungarnished.&nbsp; Rogers was a
little man, with a nice taste in diamonds.&nbsp; The time that he
did not spend in the theatre writing Press notices about his
&ldquo;star&rdquo; was devoted to running around the newspaper
offices seeking publicity for his lucubrations.</p>
<p>Rogers managed for a little lady called Minnie Palmer, who
appeared at the Strand Theatre in a sort of
pinafore-and-golden-curls part.&nbsp; She continued playing the
pinafore <i>ing&eacute;nue</i> until she was well over
forty.&nbsp; Poor little &ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; who had taught the
lady all she knew, was quite broken-hearted when she left his for
another management.&nbsp; Kelly also made his reputation in
London as manager for an actress.&nbsp; This performer was called
Grace Hawthorne.&nbsp; Miss Hawthorne took the Olympic and the
Princess&rsquo;s, and spent <a name="page277"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 277</span>quite a fortune in the attempt to
establish the position of her theatres.</p>
<p>Kelly had a humour of his own, which, if Irish in its origin,
was American in its expression.&nbsp; In the Junior Garrick Club
one afternoon some men were assembled in the hall (the
hall-porter, called &ldquo;Tap,&rdquo; was a bit of a bookmaker,
and we loyally accepted his ridiculous prices).&nbsp; The
conversation turned on lying, and some of us were relating our
experiences of great liars whom we had known, and quoting
examples of their skill.&nbsp; Kelly entered during the recital
with a member whose guest he was, and listened quietly for a
while; then, taking advantage of the first pause, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess what you fellows know about lyin&rsquo;
ain&rsquo;t worth a cent.&nbsp; There are only three liars in the
world . . . is one, <i>and Rogers is the other
two</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Wilson Barrett produced Mr. Caine&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ben My
Chree&rdquo; at the Princess&rsquo;s, Kelly had some rights in
either the piece or the theatre.&nbsp; After the first
performance, Kelly went round to Barrett&rsquo;s dressing-room,
and urged the actor to cut down the dialogue before again
presenting the piece.&nbsp; The critics, Kelly assured him, were
very much annoyed by the length of some of the speeches.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe it,&rdquo; replied Barrett
reassuringly.&nbsp; &ldquo;To-morrow morning every paper in
London will have over a column of unadulterated praise, and the
booking-office will be besieged by a public mad to buy
seats!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In relating the incident to me, Kelly concluded thus:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Wilson Barrett was right.&nbsp; The following
morning they brought the papers up to my bedroom.&nbsp;
<i>Times</i>, a solid column of sugar-candy; <i>Telegraph</i>, a
column and a quarter of molasses, laid on thick; <i>Post</i>,
syrup suited for Society.&nbsp; I dressed in a hurry, raced
through my breakfast, ordered a hansom, and told the man to drive
like the devil to the Princess&rsquo;s Theatre.&nbsp; I was
anxious to see the queue waiting to book, as discerned in the
prophetic vision of my actor-managerial confr&egrave;re.&nbsp;
Never before did the journey from St. John&rsquo;s Wood to Oxford
Street appear so long.&nbsp; It was just on noon when we passed
through Oxford Circus, but by the time we passed Peter
Robinson&rsquo;s I could see a crowd <a name="page278"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 278</span>gathered in front of the
theatre.&nbsp; &lsquo;By Cr&oelig;sus, Barrett&rsquo;s right
again!&rsquo; I said to myself as I paid the cabby and turned to
enter the house; and then the horrible truth burst upon me.&nbsp;
The crowd was entirely composed of Wilson Barrett&rsquo;s
creditors!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was very little <i>pose</i> about the pressman of the
jocund days.&nbsp; There was an editorial <i>pose</i>, of
course&mdash;that was as essential as an ecclesiastical or as a
judicial <i>pose</i>&mdash;but among the rank and file nothing of
the sort was known, and nothing of the sort would have been
tolerated.&nbsp; Journalists were like so many schoolboys grown
up, and affectations of all kinds were an abomination to them;
yet the seed for some of the artistic make-believe which is now
so wide spread was sown in an earlier and, I venture to think, a
more healthy time.</p>
<p>Thus, what a mighty growth of rank vegetation has followed the
discovery by Swinburne of Fitzgerald&rsquo;s paraphrase of the
&ldquo;Rubaiyat&rdquo; of Omar Khayy&aacute;m!&nbsp;
Swinburne&rsquo;s &ldquo;find&rdquo; in Quaritch&rsquo;s shop
was, perhaps, the most important event that ever took place
there.&nbsp; From a commercial point of view the transaction was
naught, for the neglected verses were rescued by the poet from
the &ldquo;All these at twopence&rdquo; box of the expert in old
editions.&nbsp; Nor was there anything at all sensational in the
circumstance of one poet lighting upon the undiscovered genius of
a brother bard.&nbsp; One can understand Swinburne&rsquo;s keen
delight and sympathetic appreciation, but what of the rising
flood of slushy adulation which has followed on the part of men
who are without literary discrimination or poetic insight?&nbsp;
The names of eminent members of the Press appear in the lists of
those assembled to do honour to the memory of the Persian
voluptuary.&nbsp; This is a pity, I think.&nbsp; To be in harmony
with their object, these celebrations should be orgies, and as
long as they are conducted on any other lines they should be left
to the professors of a vapid dilettantism.</p>
<p>Omar Khayy&aacute;m had a fine sense of humour, and, scanning
mundane affairs from his retreat in Paradise, he must sometimes
shake with laughter as he regards the class of admirers who
assemble and meet together, drinking to his memory, <a
name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 279</span>sending
roses to be planted on his grave, and ruffling it for a night in
the character of irresponsible roisterers.&nbsp; There is a touch
of the comic about the situation that just redeems it; otherwise,
it were pitiful.&nbsp; What on earth does old Omar make in that
galley?&nbsp; The dominant note of the diners is that of a
stifling modernity.&nbsp; The purveyors of literary gossip are
here, with the prurient and the an&aelig;mic, and the few normal
persons who are present are here from a mere desire to gratify
their curiosity or their gregariousness.&nbsp; All are in the
attire decreed by social convention for functions of the
sort.&nbsp; Many of them wear spectacles.&nbsp; When the hour
strikes, and the operation of the Licensing Act compels them to
bring their feast to an end, they &ldquo;taxi&rdquo; off to their
suburban villas, where they pay rates and elect Borough
Councillors.&nbsp; Here they are &ldquo;waited up for&rdquo; by
their faithful wives, middle-aged and highly respectable matrons,
to whom, with more or less lucidity, they relate all they have
been doing and saying in honour of a lusty human animal of
primeval instincts, who, had he any &ldquo;say&rdquo; in the
matter, would eloquently resent the familiarity which is being
taken with his name by persons with whom he could never have had
anything in common.</p>
<p>And this reflection reminds me of an incident related to me by
Sala.&nbsp; He told it of James Hannay.&nbsp; That accomplished
writer was a great admirer of the works of Horace, and on
December 8&mdash;the poet&rsquo;s birthday&mdash;he gave a dinner
in honour of his favourite author.&nbsp; At these annual
assemblies the majority of the guests were men having a scholarly
acquaintance with the writings of Quintus Horatius Flaccus.&nbsp;
On one of these anniversaries it happened that the scholarly
persons were all prevented from attending, and Hannay found
himself surrounded at dinner by friends whose knowledge of
Horace, if anything at all, was of a schoolboy and negligible
kind.&nbsp; It was Hannay&rsquo;s custom on these occasions to
propose one toast&mdash;&ldquo;The Memory of Horace.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He rose to make his customary address, which he brought to a
conclusion in the following words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would that the great poet were with us now!&nbsp; Here
he would tell us of his Venusian home under the shadow of <a
name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 280</span>the Apulian
Hills; here he would explain the recondite personal allusions in
his &lsquo;Satires&rsquo;; here he would lift the veil from his
inner life in quoting passages from the &lsquo;Epistles&rsquo;;
here he would recite, as only he could, his lighter or his graver
&lsquo;Odes,&rsquo; happily conscious of the fact that not one
person in his hearing understood a word of the language in which
he was speaking!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, according to Sala, no one resented the pleasantry.&nbsp;
It may be assumed that Hannay was more exercised about the memory
of Horace than he was about his own.&nbsp; One never hears him
quoted now; yet he established a claim on the memory of posterity
far more valid than that of a score of writers who have become
accepted as speaking with authority.&nbsp; His &ldquo;Satire and
Satirists&rdquo; proves him to be as fine a master of satire as
many of those with whom he deals.&nbsp; His &ldquo;Singleton
Fontenoy&rdquo; is full of wit and humour, and the shrewd wisdom
of a thorough man of the world.&nbsp; He wrote largely in the
<i>Quarterly Review</i>, was a contributor to <i>Punch</i>, and a
regular writer on the Press.&nbsp; There is no English critic to
whose pages I revert with keener satisfaction; but that taste is
not general.&nbsp; Hannay, alas! has written his name in
water.</p>
<p>Charles Reade wrote one of the greatest novels produced in the
Victorian era&mdash;I refer, of course, to &ldquo;The Cloister
and the Hearth&rdquo;&mdash;and he was probably one of the
greatest personalities of his own time.&nbsp; I knew him fairly
well.&nbsp; Like Robert Buchanan, he was ready to rush into
newspaper correspondence on the slightest provocation, and,
having once commenced operations, he hit out in a way that was
perfectly wonderful; yet&mdash;again like poor Buchanan&mdash;he
was a man with a soft heart and a generous nature.&nbsp; He would
roar through a whole column, hurling at his opponent the most
weird and lurid denunciations, but he bore no malice.&nbsp; He
was afflicted now and then with righteous indignation, but once
the steam was let off, he cooed like a sucking-dove.&nbsp; In the
height of his argument he would coin the most wonderful phrases,
for Reade never raged as the heathen rage.&nbsp; Tom Purnell
&ldquo;had at&rdquo; the old gentleman in the
<i>Athen&aelig;um</i>, and Reade was out after his scalp in <a
name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 281</span>rather less
than no time.&nbsp; His philippic on this occasion incidentally
enriched the English language by the addition of a word.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Pseudonymuncule&rdquo; was the epithet which he forged for
the confusion of his opponent.</p>
<p>Reade was a big burly man, with a grey beard, short
clipped.&nbsp; Henry Byron once described him as &ldquo;Great
Briton,&rdquo; and the phrase was apt enough.&nbsp; A tumultuous,
overwhelming personage was Reade.&nbsp; His advertisements to
&ldquo;Thief Takers,&rdquo; offering rewards to those who caught
unscrupulous persons pirating his works, were surely the
&ldquo;maddest, merriest&rdquo; things ever set up in type; yet
they were quite seriously meant by their author.&nbsp; On the
subject of piracy he was always in deadly earnest.&nbsp; One of
his last contributions to the Press was a series of articles in
the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> on &ldquo;Ambidextrous
Man.&rdquo;&nbsp; On this subject he waxed as emphatic,
insistent, and eloquent as if the world were arrayed in one great
stupid conspiracy against his contention.&nbsp; As a matter of
fact, the world did not care a farthing about it one way or the
other.&nbsp; Perhaps his most dramatic exhibition of violent
indignation was afforded when the authorities wanted to acquire
his house at Albert Gate.&nbsp; Among other devices to which he
resorted in order to bring his persecutors to their senses was a
very characteristic one.&nbsp; He had a huge board affixed to the
forefront of his dwelling, and painted thereon, for all the world
to see, was the legend &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Naboth&rsquo;s
Vineyard</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp; One would have imagined that this
would have stricken his enemies with a sense of shame.&nbsp; In
that direction, however, I regret to say, it failed.</p>
<p>When the prize-ring was set up between four walls, and its
contests decided after dinner before a mob of gentlemen in
evening dress, its chief London home was, and is, the National
Sporting Club.&nbsp; The National Sporting Club was not the
direct descendant of the prize-ring, but came to the sons of men
by way of the West London Rowing Club, in connection with which
there was a boxing-club supported by such sportsmen as
&ldquo;Pills&rdquo; Holloway, &ldquo;Nobby&rdquo; Hall, and other
gentlemen pugilists.&nbsp; The umpires, referees, and
time-keepers at the National Sporting Club had graduated <a
name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 282</span>at the West
London, which had its premises on the tow-path by Putney
Bridge.&nbsp; The chief of these were Mr. &ldquo;Jack&rdquo;
Angle, Mr. Vyse, and Mr. &ldquo;Tom&rdquo; Anderson, of the Board
of Trade.&nbsp; All three were men of dress and of
address&mdash;what used to be called &ldquo;swells,&rdquo; in
fact&mdash;and Anderson was always noted for the wonderful depth
of his linen collars; indeed, he may be said to have set that
fashion in collars which a few years since bid fair to strangle
the rising hope of England.&nbsp; Whenever a boxing contest came
off at the National Sporting, the names of these three veterans
of the gloves appeared in the newspapers publishing reports of
the &ldquo;fights.&rdquo;&nbsp; When Sir Courtney Boyle became
Chief of the Board of Trade, he was scandalized to find the name
of a gentleman holding an important position in the office
appearing publicly in such a degrading connection, and Anderson
was tabled, and informed that if he wished to retain his position
he must abandon all official connection with the
&ldquo;ring.&rdquo;&nbsp; Anderson&rsquo;s resentment may,
perhaps, be found expressed in the fact that shortly afterwards
Sir Courtney became known in Whitehall as &ldquo;Doubtful
Boyle.&rdquo;&nbsp; On being asked the meaning of the sobriquet,
Anderson would slyly answer: &ldquo;The chief is so called
because he is always in doubt as to whether godamighty made him
or he made godamighty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the National Sporting Club was yet unthought of, and when
the premises they occupy was still Evans&rsquo;s Hotel, there was
a tobacconist&rsquo;s shop next door, and behind the shop there
was an American bowling-alley.&nbsp; This was
Kilpack&rsquo;s.&nbsp; It was an old-fashioned shop, and the
customers sat on tobacco-barrels beside the counter.&nbsp; The
bowling-alley was not much frequented when I knew it; but earlier
in the nineteenth century it had a vogue, I understand.&nbsp; It
was a capital alley, and I have enjoyed many a game there with
citizens of the United States, who did not, I am bound to
confess, take much stock in the pastime.&nbsp; Behind the counter
of the cigar-shop was a middle-aged man, very genial and
reminiscent.&nbsp; The customers always called him
&ldquo;Kilpack,&rdquo; and he always &ldquo;answered&rdquo; to
that name; but the original Kilpacks had disappeared long before,
and this <a name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
283</span>amiable person&mdash;probably a Smith or a
Jones&mdash;thought it a safe policy to carry on the old
traditions under the old name.&nbsp; Kilpack&rsquo;s was</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A link within the days to bind<br />
The generations each to each.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I see these old landmarks disappear one by one from the
face of the Metropolitan area, I experience a pang of bereavement
as at the death of an old friend.&nbsp; The site upon which the
demolished Kilpack&rsquo;s once stood is now occupied by the
premises of a draper.</p>
<p>I never had much to do with the money-lending
fraternity.&nbsp; I tried on one occasion to borrow fifty of Sam
Lewis.&nbsp; I may mention at once that I did not succeed.&nbsp;
But my visit on the occasion to 17, Cork Street established a
friendship between Sam and myself which continued until his
death.&nbsp; I have heard a good many stories about the rapacity
of Sam in his professional capacity.&nbsp; His critics forget to
estimate the risks which he continually took, and when one
remembers the sort of men his principal &ldquo;clients&rdquo;
were, and the eventual destination of the millions which the
worthy Sam accumulated, it must be admitted that the public has
benefited by the transactions.&nbsp; Had the vast sums of
interest which Sam Lewis hauled in from clients like Ailesbury
percolated through other channels, Society would not have been a
halfpenny the better.&nbsp; As it was, the Lewis millions went in
the end to benefit hospitals and other great public
charities.&nbsp; Sam left a lot to be disposed of in this way,
leaving the bulk of his little savings to his wife.&nbsp; That
lady did not survive her husband by many years, and her will
added enormously to the benefactions devised by her
husband.&nbsp; In the testamentary acts of both husband and wife
the Christian charities were as liberally treated as were those
distinctively Jewish.</p>
<p>Lewis was a dapper, well-dressed little man, with a bald head
and a smile of winning quality; indeed, all Sam&rsquo;s qualities
were winning qualities.&nbsp; His offices were on the first-floor
of the house next door to the Blue Posts in Cork Street, and
impecunious <i>fl&acirc;neurs</i> emerging from the Burlington
Arcade were often blessed by a sight of the back of <a
name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 284</span>Sam&rsquo;s
head as he leaned against the window talking to some
&ldquo;forlorn and shipwrecked brother&rdquo; intent on
discovering the wherewithal on which to &ldquo;take heart
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lewis began life as a traveller in real and sham jewellery, to
which he added, as time went on, some little adventures on his
own account in the tally-man arena of British enterprise.&nbsp;
The most melancholy young man I ever saw was his clerk&mdash;one
Gilbey by name.&nbsp; Whether this young man&rsquo;s melancholy
was constitutional or was caused by his acquaintance with the
seamy side of Society, or by the monotonous filling up of bills
for Sam&rsquo;s clients to sign, I never could make out.&nbsp;
Sam&rsquo;s chief jackal was one Alfred Snelling, whose office
was in a little house looking down Savile Row.</p>
<p>Not often have the betting ring and the tipsters and
&ldquo;the boys&rdquo; generally come across so soft a thing as
they found in Ernest Benzon, whose meteoric course lasted just
two years.&nbsp; It must be confessed that this extraordinary
young man contrived to fill the public eye during that period to
the exclusion of more useful subjects, and it cost him just a
quarter of a million of money to achieve that splendid
notoriety.&nbsp; The fortune to which Benzon&mdash;known during
his brief career on the turf as &ldquo;the Jubilee
Juggins&rdquo;&mdash;succeeded was made by his father, a
Birmingham man.&nbsp; The trade by which it was accumulated was
that of constructing umbrella-frames.&nbsp; That a fortune thus
made should have been inherited by one who was utterly oblivious
to the necessity of laying by something for a rainy day strikes a
reflective person as being at once strange and sad.&nbsp; Benzon
did not acquire the sobriquet &ldquo;Juggins&rdquo; for
nothing.&nbsp; He was the last man in the world to whom the
control of a fortune should have been committed.</p>
<p>Benzon was absolutely vain, frivolous, and assertive.&nbsp; He
fancied himself no end at things for which he had no very great
aptitude.&nbsp; As an instance of this, I remember quite well how
he challenged John Roberts at pyramids for a sovereign a
ball.&nbsp; Of course, Roberts &ldquo;took him on,&rdquo; with
what result can be imagined.&nbsp; He had that sort of sickly
sentimentality which may be encountered in the sixpenny gallery
of the homes of melodrama&mdash;a sentimentality which <a
name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 285</span>can exist
in natures incapable of any quite genuine emotion.&nbsp; Benzon
squandered money, and doubtless was robbed of money; but I have
never heard a case in which he spent money on a generous impulse
or with the intention of doing an act of solid benefit to an
individual or to the human race.&nbsp; Yet I accompanied him on
one occasion to the Adelphi Theatre.&nbsp; A melodrama of the
ordinary Adelphi sort was being played, and Benzon became so
extremely touched by the sufferings of the heroine that he began
blubbering like a child.&nbsp; Nor can it be said that the
exhibition was explicable on the ground that the
&ldquo;Juggins&rdquo; was &ldquo;crying drunk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Benzon had melted his patrimony of a quarter of a
million, he thought to maintain his notoriety by telling the
world how he had managed to do it.&nbsp; To this motive may be
attributed the appearance of a book attributed to him, and
entitled, &ldquo;How I Lost &pound;250,000 in Two
Years.&rdquo;&nbsp; His friends now considered that a new and
reputable career was opened up to him; for the work was extremely
well written, and the &ldquo;Jubilee Juggins&rdquo; accepted with
never-failing geniality the congratulations which were showered
upon him.&nbsp; But even here Benzon was fated to be a
disappointment to his friends.&nbsp; Some months after the book
appeared an action was brought against the publisher by Vero
Shaw.&nbsp; From the evidence given during the hearing it
transpired that, save for the two words &ldquo;Ernest
Benzon&rdquo; which appeared under his likeness opposite the
title-page, not a scrap of the work had been done by the
&ldquo;Juggins&rdquo; himself.&nbsp; It was all the work of Vero
Shaw, constructed out of such flimsy materials as could be
gathered from the vapid conversation of the devoted plunger and
the diary of the latter&rsquo;s tutor.</p>
<p>The last time I saw Benzon he was somewhat less of the
butterfly than in the days of his vanity.&nbsp; He was living on
an inalienable income paid weekly.&nbsp; His salient qualities
were selfishness and silliness.&nbsp; He was what
&ldquo;bookies&rdquo; used to call &ldquo;a fly-flat,&rdquo; and,
I may add, more flat than fly.</p>
<p>Saturday-to-Mondaying became recognized as having a place
among British sports and pastimes some time at the close of the
seventies, I think.&nbsp; It was started, like so many <a
name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 286</span>other
delightful innovations, by Bohemians.&nbsp; Having once
&ldquo;caught on,&rdquo; it was adopted by Society, and in quite
recent years became recognized under the name which it originally
and naturally bore.&nbsp; But though Society has
sanctioned&mdash;or shall I say sanctified?&mdash;the term, the
first public allusion to the beneficent custom was on the stage
of the music-hall, and was made by Miss Marie Lloyd or
another.&nbsp; The stimulating refrain ran: &ldquo;Oh, will you
be my Saturday-to-Monday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charles Wyndham was one of the first of the theatrical
profession to recognize in the Thames Valley a peaceful resort in
which, after the Saturday performance, to rest and study and
contrive.&nbsp; It was at a very critical period in the history
of the Criterion, and the ambitious manager&mdash;surely the
finest of English comedians&mdash;was suffering all the horrors
of insomnia.&nbsp; Affairs were balanced on the edge of a knife,
as it were, at the theatre, and it was doubtful whether the
courageous young manager could hold on or not.&nbsp; His
objective in those days was the Swan, at Thames Ditton, and here
for the greater part of Sunday he would shut himself up in a
private room studying manuscript plays, French and English of
their kind.&nbsp; All who knew him then rejoiced when a brilliant
success at last followed his judgment in selection, and the
anxiety and the insomnia simultaneously disappeared.&nbsp; Those
who have only known him in later years as the rich and popular
Sir Charles Wyndham will learn that his success&mdash;like all
solid and lasting successes&mdash;was strenuously won.</p>
<p>But it was not until a later period that the general weekend
migration of Bohemia to the Thames set in with yearly increasing
severity.&nbsp; And those who followed Wyndham to the river of
pleasure did not, you may be quite sure, follow his example in
the matter of arduous study.&nbsp; A good deal of
&ldquo;shop&rdquo; was talked, no doubt, at the merry
forgatherings of actors in flannels and actresses in white
frocks&mdash;actors will pass their time in heaven talking
&ldquo;shop&rdquo;&mdash;but serious consideration of the
business of the theatre was as a rule taboo.&nbsp; The spirit of
the little assemblages of friends all along the Valley was
frankly a holiday spirit; the dominant <a
name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 287</span>note of the
Bohemian parties was gaiety.&nbsp; The Saturday-to-Monday
establishments spread themselves from Twickenham&mdash;then below
locks&mdash;to Datchet.&nbsp; Nowadays the profession may be
found encamped higher up the stream.&nbsp; But there were no
motors in the dark days of which I am writing, and players whose
engagements were in or near the Strand were limited to the river
resorts served by the South-Western Railway Company.&nbsp;
Whatever disadvantages may have been incident on this limitation,
it had the advantage of placing the week-enders from the theatres
within visiting distance of each other.</p>
<p>D&rsquo;Oyly Carte hired a big house at Hampton, close to
Tagg&rsquo;s Island, where he entertained largely on
Sundays.&nbsp; It had a lawn running down to the river&mdash;a
lawn on which I have met some very pleasant people, but none as
pleasant and unassuming as Carte himself, or more hospitable and
gracious than his talented wife.&nbsp; Carte evidently regarded
the Thames as an ideal stream by which to live, for he afterwards
bought an eyot higher upstream, and built a house on it.</p>
<p>Higher up the stream, at Sunbury, there was a cheery Bohemian
colony where the fun never flagged.&nbsp; &ldquo;Cis&rdquo;
Chappel&rsquo;s cottage by the river was one of the centres of
the settlement.&nbsp; Among his visitors&mdash;also of the
colony&mdash;were Captain Fred Russell, whose quaint humour and
whose fame as a raconteur were enhanced by a slight stammer,
which, instead of marring, heightened his effects.&nbsp; Alfred
Benjamin, of bulldog fame, was free of this circle, in virtue of
having &ldquo;married on to the stage,&rdquo; so to speak, Mrs.
Benjamin having been one of the vestals who had kept burning
HoIIingshead&rsquo;s &ldquo;sacred lamp of burlesque&rdquo; at
the Gaiety.&nbsp; Other bright and beautiful women were among
Chappel&rsquo;s visitors, chief among these being Miss Nellie
Farren, who had a residence not far off, and whose presence and
fine flow of animal spirits prevented the possibility of any dull
moments.&nbsp; The Magpie Hotel, with a landing-stage to the
river, was a famous gathering place for the members of the
theatrical profession, more especially on Sunday
afternoons.&nbsp; Old Freeman, the landlord, has long since
abandoned Clarke&rsquo;s ferry for that <a
name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 288</span>of
Charon.&nbsp; He had the general appearance of a
stage-butler&mdash;artificial smirk and all&mdash;and he made a
nice fortune by catering for the gay and irresponsible youth who
frequented his establishment.</p>
<p>Still farther upstream was Shepperton.&nbsp; Here of a morning
the handsome Harry B. Conway might be seen leaving his cottage,
preceded by the two noisiest collies ever littered.&nbsp; Conway,
surely the best-looking Romeo who ever played the part, was a
connection of the Byron family, and possessed all the good looks
of his famous relative.&nbsp; It is to be feared that he
inherited also some of the other idiosyncrasies of the author of
&ldquo;Don Juan.&rdquo;&nbsp; Henry Pottinger Stephens had for
some time a house farther inland from the river.&nbsp; He had
hired the place furnished.&nbsp; The grounds were surrounded by a
high wall, the visitor at the gate being scanned through a grille
before admission.&nbsp; The retreat was as private as a
nunnery.&nbsp; Once inside, &ldquo;Pot&rsquo;s&rdquo; visitor
would be struck by the excessive number of copies of the Holy
Scriptures which were to be found in the rooms.&nbsp; It used to
amuse &ldquo;Pot&rdquo; to stimulate the curiosity of his guests
on this point, and then to explain the mystery by observing that
he had hired the house of Mr. Bagster, the Bible publisher of
Paternoster Row.</p>
<p>Above the lock, and on the Chertsey side of the river, Sir
Charles Dilke had built himself the most retired little bungalow
on all the river.&nbsp; Neither from the stream nor from the
shore approaches was the house visible.&nbsp; It seemed to be
sunk in osier-beds and embowered in willows.&nbsp; Theodore Hook
I think it was who described the advantage of having a riverside
cottage as consisting in the fact that &ldquo;in the summer you
had the river at the bottom of your garden, and that in the
winter you had the garden at the bottom of your
river.&rdquo;&nbsp; I should imagine that in the winter, not only
the garden, but the house itself, must sometimes have been at the
bottom of the river in the case of Sir Charles Dilke&rsquo;s
Chertsey home.</p>
<p>At Staines &ldquo;Tommy&rdquo; Brett, a member of the Bar,
conspicuous for his negligence in the matter of dress, had his
week-end quarters.&nbsp; He practised on the Chancery side, and
was half mad on the subject of horse-racing.&nbsp; To hear and <a
name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 289</span>see Tommy
describe a close finish was one of the funniest entertainments
possible.&nbsp; In his excitement, the little man would get down
to his work, his wrists and elbows playing, his knees pressed in,
his neck craned forward, and his hat pressed to the very back of
his head.&nbsp; Brett was in deadly earnest all the time, while
to his audience the performance appealed as a piece of the most
extraordinary burlesque.&nbsp; Fortunately, Tommy&rsquo;s
knowledge of law was much more sound than his knowledge of
horse-racing.&nbsp; On the other side of the river to Staines is
Egham Hythe, and here Vero Shaw had a pleasant establishment
known as Wapshot Farm.&nbsp; The author of &ldquo;The Book of the
Dog&rdquo; was here experimenting in pigeon-breeding, and at
Wapshot Farm there was always a warm welcome to friends on the
part of the most cheery of hosts and the most hospitable of
hostesses.&nbsp; Mrs. Shaw was noted on the Staines reach, and on
reaches above and below it, for her success as a Thames
angler.</p>
<p>With the advent of the house-boat an era of greater
luxuriousness was inaugurated.&nbsp; At first the house-boat was
a floating structure of small proportions and humble
pretensions&mdash;the home of some artist or some devoted lover
of the Thames who had become tired of camping out.&nbsp; But the
possibilities of the thing were soon gauged by those to whom
money was not very much of an object.&nbsp; The first of the
house-boats on a really large and luxurious scale was built for
Mr. O&rsquo;Hagan of Hampton by Tom Tagg.&nbsp; Once the game was
started, it went on merrily, and continueth even unto this day,
although the motor has diverted many of the wealthy from a
pastime which, from one point of view at least, must be regarded
as &ldquo;slow.&rdquo;&nbsp; Colonel North, the Nitrate King, as
they called him in the City, set up a house-boat on a grand
scale.&nbsp; He called her <i>The Golden Butterfly</i>, and on
board this gorgeous floating pleasure-house he gave princely
entertainments to the ornaments of the stage and his City
friends.&nbsp; John L. Shine, the actor, had gained the good
graces of the egregious Nitrate King&mdash;who, while recklessly
hospitable, was hopelessly vulgar&mdash;and he did a lot of the
inviting for the florid and red-whiskered magnate.&nbsp; Where
City men of the &ldquo;Woolpack&rdquo; type, ladies of the
theatre, unlimited champagne, <a name="page290"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 290</span>and a host free of any bigoted
regard for the <i>convenances</i>, are the chief elements of a
gathering, the fun should have been fast and furious&mdash;as,
indeed, it sometimes was.</p>
<p>William Hudson, the wine-merchant, had a house-boat right away
from the more crowded reaches of the Thames.&nbsp; She lay off
the Mapledurham meadows, belonging to the Blount family.&nbsp;
Hudson&rsquo;s boat was called <i>The Little Billee</i>, and he
kept moored near by an excellent steam-launch, the
<i>Martlet</i>, and a whole flotilla of skiffs, punts, and canoes
for the use of his visitors.&nbsp; In the internal fittings of
the <i>Little Billee</i> Hudson went in not so much for airy
grace as for solid comfort.&nbsp; And no man on all the Thames
gave better weekend dinners.&nbsp; He liked to have around him
guests who could talk, and who could talk well.&nbsp; All sorts
and conditions of people met at his board, but one never met
there a man who was not interesting.&nbsp; Travellers, authors,
journalists, merchants, Conservative Members of Parliament, and
Irish Nationalist Members of the same august assembly, I have met
at Hudson&rsquo;s week-end parties on the <i>Little
Billee</i>.&nbsp; And if the after-dinner talk was always kept up
to the right conversational pitch, much of the credit was due to
the keenness and tact of a host who delighted in the
conversational &ldquo;give and take&rdquo; of clever men.</p>
<p>On the upper and on the lower reaches of the Thames the upper
and the lower reaches of literature&mdash;if I may so describe
them&mdash;were represented.&nbsp; Thus, at Kelmscott, by
Lechlade, Rossetti and Morris were producing enduring work; while
down at Isleworth Mr. Le Queux was reporting at County Courts and
Boards of Guardians for the <i>Middlesex Chronicle</i>, innocent
as yet of the many sensational crimes which, in six-shilling
volumes, he has since committed; and at Richmond Mr. Bloundelle
Burton was daily treading on historic ground without so much as
contemplating the historic novel.&nbsp; At Teddington, Blackmore,
having abandoned Devonshire and the novel of the West, was
devoting himself to the pleasurable and profitable pursuit of
market gardening.&nbsp; All sorts and conditions of the
cultivators of literature sought the banks of the Thames; and if
Edmund Yates, of <a name="page291"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
291</span>the <i>World</i>, had a delightful place at Goring,
Purkiss, of the <i>Police Gazelle</i>, had a still more luxurious
home at Shepperton.</p>
<p>In the eighties, too, the river began to have a literature of
its own.&nbsp; Of these, <i>Lock to Lock</i> lingers on to this
day.&nbsp; The <i>Thames</i> was a more serious and a more
pretentious paper.&nbsp; It was under the editorship of one of
the Mackays&mdash;William, I think&mdash;and to its powerful and
continuous advocacy the public are indebted for the lock below
Richmond, an improvement which can only be appreciated by those
who can remember the exposed bed of the river between Isleworth
and Teddington at the height of a hot summer.&nbsp; During one
such year it was possible to walk across that part of the river
which was supposed to run between Twickenham foreshore and Eel
Pie Island.</p>
<p>To one who comes early under the subtle influence of the
Thames there is no other water which shall ever possess the same
attraction.&nbsp; One falls in love with it, and thereafter can
see only its perfections.&nbsp; No stream has been so celebrated
in verse.&nbsp; From Spenser and Drayton to Cowley and Pope, from
Cowley and Pope to Matthew Arnold and Theo Marzials, there
stretches a long list of illustrious versifiers who found
inspiration in the Thames.&nbsp; And if Pope might so exaggerate
the objects of his poetic vision as to behold &ldquo;. . . the
Muses sport on Cooper&rsquo;s Hill,&rdquo; the more modern bard,
Mr. Theo Marzials, may be forgiven for metamorphosing the
Twickenham ferryman.&nbsp; The song presents that waterman as a
dashing young Lothario.&nbsp; The unhappy fact is that, at the
time when Marzials wrote the once popular song, the ferryman was
a fat, oleaginous old man named Cooper, with no sentiment of any
kind about him save a sentimental feeling for beer.</p>
<p>Through all my memories of the journalistic life the Thames
sings softly.&nbsp; When I look back, a thousand delightful
recollections of its bosom and its banks inevitably obtrude, even
while I try to concentrate on the busy haunts of men.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Sweete Temmes!&rdquo;</p>

292</span>CHAPTER XIX<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE PRESS IN TRANSITION</span></h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Old familiar
declining and falling off.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Silas
Wegg</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">All</span> things earthly,&rdquo;
said the wit, &ldquo;have an end&mdash;except Upper Wimpole
Street.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the end of the Press has been cheerfully
foretold by the Jeremiahs of Fleet Street.&nbsp; So obvious, I
have been recently informed, have become the symptoms of
disintegration and decay in the institution known under the style
and title of &ldquo;The Daily Press&rdquo; that the publicist who
would call attention to the fact must be prepared to hold himself
rather cheap.</p>
<p>Now, it is almost a truism to say that there is in the older
members of any profession an intuition which compels them to
regard their own early days in a calling as indicating the
high-water mark of that vocation, whatever it may have
been.&nbsp; The reason for this curious attitude of the human
mind is not very far to seek.&nbsp; To parody Lytton, &ldquo;the
youthful and the beautiful are one.&rdquo;&nbsp; And a profession
regarded by one who is young, ardent, impressionable, and
credulous, will not appear the same thing to him when he views
it, in its new developments, with old eyes and in a spirit of
detachment.&nbsp; That which differs in the new constitution from
the conditions of the old he will regard as bad or puerile or
reactionary.&nbsp; The old things he sees through a golden haze;
the new he regards with the rheumy eyes of the
valetudinarian.</p>
<p>In the old newspaper man this instinct to depreciate the
present I have found very strong.&nbsp; His pose is invariably
that of the <i>laudator temporis acti</i>.&nbsp; In all its
departments and through all its methods he observes what Wegg
calls &ldquo;the Decline-and-Fall-Off&rdquo; of the daily
paper.&nbsp; Old actors are very much like old pressmen in this
respect.&nbsp; Their <a name="page293"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 293</span>early days were always &ldquo;the
palmy days.&rdquo;&nbsp; And as there have always been living old
actors to impress this fact on the minds of successive
generations, it is obvious that all time, past and present, was
and is that blessed period known as &ldquo;the palmy
days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But while I do not note in the newspaper Press, as it exists
to-day, those signs of disintegration and wasting&mdash;that
&ldquo;old familiar declining and falling off&rdquo;&mdash;which
have been diagnosed by aged professors, I do observe the passing
of certain stages of the evolution of the newspaper; and I can
even read in those indications the foretaste of a time when the
newspaper, as we know it now, will have ceased altogether to
exist.</p>
<p>I will endeavour to explain.</p>
<p>It is not alleged by our Jeremiah that the newspapers have
&ldquo;declined and fallen off&rdquo; in circulation.&nbsp; I
write without statistics and making a mere intelligent guess when
I estimate that there are at least four times as many copies of
newspapers sold in a day in London now as were sold in
1870.&nbsp; Here, at least, there is no indication of decline;
and if there be anything at all in the law of supply and demand,
we are bound to infer that the proprietors of newspapers must be
supplying that which the public demands.&nbsp; Public taste is
not created or directed by newspapers.&nbsp; The clever editor is
he who shrewdly anticipates the direction of the public taste,
and caters for it.&nbsp; It is a <i>flair</i> which the editor
may possess in common with the theatrical manager and the
<i>restaurateur</i>.&nbsp; He exercises it in exactly the same
way as George Edwardes exercises it or as &ldquo;Jo&rdquo; Lyons
exercises it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Find out what the fool of a public
wants, and give it to &rsquo;em!&rdquo; was the advice given me
once by the managing director of a syndicate of newspapers of the
North of England.&nbsp; And it was sound advice.</p>
<p>If this view of the whole duty of the modern editor be
correct, it involves the admission that the newspaper of to-day
has abandoned its ancient traditions, just as it has thrown aside
the worn-out clich&eacute;s.&nbsp; Half the disgust of the
journalistic Jeremiah with the new order is caused, I believe, by
the abandonment of those time-honoured clich&eacute;s.&nbsp; He
endures a pang of regret and resentment when, in reading <a
name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 294</span>the account
of a fire, he finds no allusion to &ldquo;the devouring
element.&rdquo;&nbsp; He is incapable of understanding that the
public does not care any more for &ldquo;the devouring
element,&rdquo; and that the penny-a-liner has been superseded by
the crime investigator and other weird officials called into
existence by the new reader of newspapers.</p>
<p>When our poor old Jeremiah was young, the newspaper was,
primarily, the organ of a party&mdash;sometimes its official
organ, but always, whether officially or unofficially,
representing one of the great political parties.&nbsp; Nominally,
indeed, it is so still.&nbsp; But there is no underlying
enthusiasm, nor is there any continuity of conviction.&nbsp; Many
of our &ldquo;esteemed contemporaries&rdquo; are, ostentatiously,
rail-sitters.&nbsp; But the Press has ceased to have any
influence with Cabinets, nor are editors any longer consulted by
Cabinet Ministers.&nbsp; No editor will ever again hold the
position with regard to Ministers held by Dr. Giffard of the
<i>Morning Herald</i>, or John Delane of the <i>Times</i>.&nbsp;
By the way, the Conservative party owed a great deal more than
they were ever willing to acknowledge to the said Dr.
Giffard.&nbsp; I suppose that they considered that they had wiped
out the debt when they made his son Lord Chancellor and an
Earl!&nbsp; One of these days we shall find politics left out of
our papers save at election times, when the space will be hired
by persons wishing to advertise their political convictions.</p>
<p>The new conditions under which the newspaper exists, and the
new methods introduced by its conductors, were foreordained,
though not foreseen, when Mr. Forster&rsquo;s Education Bill
became law, and the School Board education was offered to the
youth of merry England.&nbsp; Paterfamilias bought his newspaper
in the dark ages before Forster.&nbsp; The generations that
developed under Forster&rsquo;s Act demanded newspapers of their
own, but they were not prepared to pay a penny for them.&nbsp;
And, lo! the halfpenny Press arose at his bidding&mdash;the
bidding of the Board School boy and the bicycle boy&mdash;and
remaineth with us even unto this day.</p>
<p>Clearly, the halfpenny paper could only afford half the space
to what is known as &ldquo;original matter&rdquo; that was
accorded by its penny rival.&nbsp; Parliamentary and law <a
name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 295</span>reports
were made taboo.&nbsp; The &ldquo;snippet&rdquo; habit was
inoculated on to the vile body of the daily Press from virus
obtained from the &ldquo;Bits&rdquo; papers.&nbsp; And so eager
was the bicycle boy to swallow his tabloided doses of news that
he never discovered the inroads gradually made by the advertiser
on the spaces originally devoted to reading matter.&nbsp; Nay, so
contented was he with the latest method of presenting the news of
the day, that he did not even mind when further encroachments
were made on his news columns, and a daily portion of the
broadsheet was filched for the presentation of a solid chunk of
fifth-rate fiction.&nbsp; In his present temper the bicycle boy
appears ready to stand almost <i>anything</i>!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, and in face of this determined and successful
competition on the part of the halfpenny papers, what has been
the policy of the penny news-sheets?&nbsp; They have gone on
enlarging their borders, increasing their bulk, and adding to
their weight&mdash;adding to their weight, I mean, in the
literal, and not in the figurative, acceptation of that
phrase.&nbsp; The Parliamentary and law reports are more
formidable in their length and particularity than ever.&nbsp;
Book-reviewing is carried on to an extent hitherto only demanded
in a literary weekly; essays on engineering, gardening, motoring,
fishing, have regular days devoted to them.&nbsp; The advertisers
are no longer satisfied with a modicum of space.&nbsp; The mural
poster has been transferred to the pages of the penny morning
paper.&nbsp; Oxbridge&rsquo;s full pages have become an expected
item in the day&rsquo;s entertainment, and Coco&rsquo;s
illustrations of his physical perfections have become an integral
feature of our daily portion.&nbsp; The result is that the penny
paper has grown to an unwieldy bulk, awkward to handle,
impossible to turn over in a train or in the open, and
containing, in proportion to the small ha&rsquo;pennyworth of
what one does want, an intolerable deal of what one does not, and
is never likely to, want.</p>
<p>The general conclusion to be deduced from these necessarily
undemonstrable statements is that the fate of any given newspaper
is in the hands of the advertisers.&nbsp; Editors choose to
address themselves exclusively to their readers, and maintain a
splendid official ignorance of the advertiser.&nbsp; <a
name="page296"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 296</span>This is the
only <i>pose</i> possible to the well-regulated editor.&nbsp; Did
he for a moment admit, even to himself, that his professional
emoluments were derived from Oxbridge and the British and foreign
tradesman generally, he would no longer be able to take the Press
quite so seriously as he does; indeed, he would scarcely be able
any longer to take himself quite seriously, and that would surely
be a great pity.</p>
<p>Suppose for a moment that some other channel were
discovered&mdash;we live in an age of surprising
discoveries&mdash;which the advertisers regarded as more suited
to their requirements than the present system.&nbsp; What
happens?&nbsp; The small advertiser, whose three-and-sixpences
form the real backbone of every newspaper enterprise, follows the
big one.&nbsp; The papers shrivel up in dimensions, and down
comes the price, or, in the alternative, up go the
shutters.&nbsp; I am glad to reflect that the owners of
newspapers have made such fortunes out of their enterprise that
they can calmly face the future.</p>
<p>I have shown how the pressure of advertisers has affected the
penny papers.&nbsp; It has induced them to increase their space
and the quantity of their &ldquo;reading matter.&rdquo;&nbsp; On
the chief of the halfpenny morning papers the pressure has had an
entirely different effect.&nbsp; The astute proprietor has met
increased pressure by an increased tariff.&nbsp; The
advertiser&rsquo;s scale on the principal halfpenny paper is, I
believe, higher than that of the <i>Times</i>.&nbsp; Even at this
prohibitive rate the public presses on with a demand for
publicity for its wants.&nbsp; This impinging on the domain of
the mere reader is skilfully masked.&nbsp; Always the advertiser
is asking for, and obtaining, more space.&nbsp; The tabloids of
news are more scientifically compressed.&nbsp; Unconsidered
trifles are snipped off the stodgy chunks of negligible fiction;
for the newspaper <i>feuilleton</i> is but a sickly growth in
Fleet Street soil.&nbsp; The leading article is squeezed into a
paragraph to admit the prospectus of a pill.&nbsp; Yet the paper
is made to look the same as usual.&nbsp; There is never anything
<i>d&eacute;collet&eacute;</i> about its appearance, no matter
how much it may have been stripped.&nbsp; But here also there is
an appointed limit beyond which it will be impossible to step
without incurring the suspicion <a name="page297"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 297</span>and arousing the resentment of the
long-suffering reader.&nbsp; That limit, I apprehend, may at any
time be touched.</p>
<p>At present the newspaper habit appears to be strong, inherent,
and hereditary, in the British people.&nbsp; But is the habit
really as deep as it is widespread?&nbsp; With men of the world
the habit does not even now persist.&nbsp; The man of the world
seldom <i>reads</i> a newspaper.&nbsp; He will take a copy up,
and give a glance at stocks or at starting prices.&nbsp; In the
smoking-room of his club he will use the daily broadsheet as a
screen what time he is sleeping the sleep of the
just-tired.&nbsp; Society will, however, always want to know what
is &ldquo;going on,&rdquo; and the end of the transition period
of journalism upon which we have entered will be heralded by the
introduction of a contrivance, original, scientific, and
up-to-date, whereby the latest intelligence shall be distributed
with increased certainty and celerity, and at a moderate
cost.</p>
<p>The new contrivance, we may cheerfully assume, will make no
use whatever of paper or printer&rsquo;s ink.&nbsp; Science will
have exposed the insanitary effects of a continuous matutinal
contact with these obsolete <i>media</i>, and the common-sense of
the community will at last have discovered their curious
inadaptability.&nbsp; The newspaper microbe will become as
familiar a topic with the public as the lobster.&nbsp; Medical
Officers of Health will &ldquo;come down on&rdquo; insanitary
journals, even as in our own time they &ldquo;come down on&rdquo;
defective drains.&nbsp; When the transition period shall have
come to an end, and when the newspaper, as we know it, shall have
come to an end, too, the disseminator of news will, it may
reasonably be anticipated, appeal directly to the ear, and not to
the eye, of the public.&nbsp; Nay, seeing that to science nothing
is impossible, may we not be enabled to absorb our news without
fatiguing either ear or eye?&nbsp; We may be taught to
&ldquo;take it in through the pores,&rdquo; like Joey Ladle.</p>
<p>The eventual solution of the difficulty will, doubtless, come
to us from the element responsible for most of our modern
miracles.&nbsp; An adaptation of wireless methods with the
telephone seems to be indicated.&nbsp; The newspaper office of
the future will be a vast exchange, an enormous central depot, <a
name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 298</span>from which
the news of the day will be transmitted to scattered
subscribers.&nbsp; At these central establishments the news of
the world will continually pour in.&nbsp; Skilled hands&mdash;the
old sub-editorial hands&mdash;will winnow it, prune it, classify
it, and, generally speaking, make it ready for the million
receivers of the subscribers.&nbsp; Happily, the new order will
involve little or no abrogation of the functions of the
journalist.&nbsp; The editor, of course, is doomed, for the
public will pay for news, and not for notions.&nbsp; But even
under the journalistic order as we know it the power of the
editor has become more and more circumscribed.&nbsp; He has been
going for a long time; soon he will have gone.&nbsp; But the
position of the staff should be enhanced.&nbsp; The journalist,
who must reappear under some other title, will be brought more
under the personal control of the subscriber.&nbsp; Errors in
collection or transmission will, as in other departments, be
traced to their source.&nbsp; The members of a staff will no
longer find shelter behind the impenetrable anonymity of an
editor.&nbsp; They will have less kudos, but they will have
better pay.&nbsp; They will have become the servants of a sound
commercial undertaking, and they will have ceased to talk of
themselves as &ldquo;the Fourth Estate of the Realm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The processes of evolution are very gradual, and go
unrecorded.&nbsp; How long will this one take?&nbsp; A
century?&nbsp; Half a century?&nbsp; Shall we tie ourselves to a
date, and fix upon the year 1960 as the time of the great
consummation?</p>
<p>Let us imagine the passage of the intervening years, and seek
out Jones in the suburbs, the suburbs in 1960 meaning an area of
twenty-five miles from the City.&nbsp; Jones descends with all
his accustomed pomposity to the wife and olive-branches assembled
in the breakfast-room.&nbsp; He acknowledges the salutes of the
family with that semiregal affability which is one of his most
engaging characteristics.&nbsp; He looks through the window, and
notes with satisfaction that his aeroplane is moored to the
aero-railings&mdash;shall I say?&nbsp; Then he seats himself at
the breakfast-table, and places the &ldquo;receiver and
communicator&rdquo; in position at his side, or, rather, at the
side of his plate.&nbsp; This insignificant implement is of
silver or of gold or of <a name="page299"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 299</span>inferior metal, according to the
means or tastes of the subscriber.&nbsp; It is the &ldquo;last
word&rdquo;&mdash;as far, at least, as 1960 has gone.&nbsp; It
sucks in from the ambient air the news sent circulating from the
central depot, and by a most ingenious contrivance it will record
only such news as is demanded of it.&nbsp; This selection is
regulated by a curious arrangement of &ldquo;stops.&rdquo;&nbsp;
There is the &ldquo;City&rdquo; stop, the
&ldquo;Parliamentary&rdquo; stop, the &ldquo;Courts&rdquo; stop,
the &ldquo;Racing&rdquo; stop.&nbsp; Jones, you may depend, turns
the &ldquo;City&rdquo; tap on before any other.&nbsp; In answer
to his inquiry as to the prices of certain stocks, he obtains an
immediate answer.&nbsp; He next inquires as to the result of last
night&rsquo;s debate in the House of Commons.&nbsp; He does not
seek after sporting intelligence at the breakfast-table&mdash;bad
example to the boys, he considers it.&nbsp; Thus the news is
gently murmured to Jones as he eats his ham and eggs; for, in
spite of the advance of science, the middle-class breakfast-table
of 1960 is the middle-class breakfast-table of the early
Victorian era.&nbsp; Jones digests his mental pabulum as he
masticates his food.</p>
<p>Jones rises from his place, hastens out to his aeroplane, and
is soon purring along to Tom Tiddler&rsquo;s Ground.&nbsp; Being
a considerate paterfamilias, he leaves the &ldquo;receiver&rdquo;
at home for the use of the family.&nbsp; His unselfishness in
this respect may be discounted by a consideration of the fact
that he has another &ldquo;receiver&rdquo; at his office in the
City.&nbsp; The family gathers in turn round the little
implement&mdash;scarcely bigger than a Jew&rsquo;s-harp it
is&mdash;and apply to the vibrating atmosphere, now charged with
intelligence hot from a thousand sources, for items suited to the
domestic hearth.&nbsp; The boys have, I will suppose, had a first
&ldquo;cut in,&rdquo; clamorous about starting prices or
cricket.&nbsp; But the interests of the ladies are more various
and more widespread.&nbsp; They would know, for instance, who is
married and who dead?&nbsp; What is going on at the theatres, and
what at the Court?&nbsp; How is Society conducting itself?&nbsp;
There is no scandal about Queen Elizabeth, one may piously
hope?&nbsp; How shapes the gossip of the day, and is there an
announcement of any Great Pink Sales?</p>
<p>In ten minutes they have learned all that the heart of <a
name="page300"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 300</span>woman can
desire to know, and they have satisfied their legitimate thirst
for knowledge without having had to prosecute a weary search
through the unwieldy pages of a bulky newspaper.&nbsp; I can
imagine the fond mother of 1960 fetching a sigh as she recalls
the sad, bad system which was in vogue in the days of her
innocent childhood.&nbsp; She shudders at the memory of the
blurred, insanitary broadsheets of an earlier time.</p>
<p>And the cost? . . .&nbsp; I do not suppose that it will exceed
the amount of the subscription at present paid for the daily
delivery of a penny paper.&nbsp; It would probably &ldquo;pan
out&rdquo; at something less.&nbsp; The cost of a penny paper
totals up to something like five-and-twenty shillings a
year.&nbsp; For an annual subscription of a guinea the little
implement will probably be placed at the disposal of its
customers by the great central exchange. . . .&nbsp; So mote it
be!</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
